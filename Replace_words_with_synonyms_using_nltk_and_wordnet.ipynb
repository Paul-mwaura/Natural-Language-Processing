Over half of the 77 million acutely foodinsecure people in countries where conflict was identified as the\\nprimary driver were in the Middle East and Asia. Regional crises\\ncontinued to see high levels of acute food insecurity, particularly\\nin the Lake Chad Basin and Central Sahel.\\nAfrica had the largest numbers of acutely food-insecure people in\\nneed of assistance in countries badly affected by weather events,\\nparticularly in the Horn of Africa and Southern Africa, followed by\\nCentral America and Pakistan.\\nIn East Africa, armed conflicts, intercommunal violence and\\nother localized tensions continued to affect peace and security,\\nparticularly in South Sudan, and continued to maintain large\\nrefugee populations in neighbouring countries, such as Uganda.\\nThe report reflects the growing influence of economic crises\\non acute food insecurity levels, particularly in the Bolivarian\\nRepublic of Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Haiti and the Sudan.\\nAn estimated 79 million people remained displaced globally\\nas of mid-2019 – 44 million of them internally displaced and\\n20 million were refugees under UNHCR’s mandate. More\\nthan half of these refugees were hosted in countries with high\\nnumbers of acutely food-insecure people. In countries where\\nfunding constraints have reduced assistance in refugee camps,\\nrefugees’ food security was severely threatened.\\nShort-term outlook for 2020\\nThe acute food insecurity forecasts for 2020 were produced\\nbefore COVID-19 became a pandemic and do not account for its\\nlikely impact in food crisis countries.\\nThe combined effects of conflict, macroeconomic crisis, climaterelated shocks and crop pests, including fall armyworm and\\ndesert locusts, were likely to ensure that Yemen remained the\\nworld's worst food crisis.\\nIn East Africa, abundant seasonal rains benefitted crops and\\nrangelands, but fostered a severe desert locust outbreak that\\nwill likely aggravate acute food insecurity in complex and fragile\\ncontexts.\\nProtracted conflicts will either maintain or increase acute food\\ninsecurity levels in parts of Central Africa. In Southern Africa,\\npost-harvest improvements are likely to be short-lived as poor\\n2020\\nThe number of acutely malnourished\\nchildren under 5 years across the 55 17M countries/territories analysed in 2019\\nrains, high food prices and unresolved political and economic\\ninstability could worsen acute food insecurity levels. Increasing\\nviolence, displacements and disrupted agriculture and trade in\\ntandem with adverse climate in West Africa and Sahel countries\\nwill worsen acute food insecurity conditions in many areas.\\nViolent conflict and currency depreciation will drive alarming\\nrates of acute food insecurity and acute malnutrition levels across\\nthe most troubled areas of the Middle East and Asia.\\nIn Latin America and the Caribbean, sociopolitical crises, weather\\nextremes, lack of employment and high food prices are likely to\\nlead to deteriorating acute food insecurity in some countries.\\nThe drivers of food crises, as well as lack of access to dietary\\nenergy and diversity, safe water, sanitation and health care\\nwill continue to create high levels of child malnutrition, while\\nCOVID-19 is likely to overburden health systems.\\nThe pandemic may well devastate livelihoods and food security,\\nespecially in fragile contexts and particularly for the most\\nvulnerable people working in the informal agricultural and nonagricultural sectors. A global recession will majorly disrupt food\\nsupply chains.\\nWhile all partners are in broad agreement with the data and information\\npresented in this report, FEWS NET’s analyses suggest that the population\\nrequiring emergency food assistance in 2019 was lower than the IPC estimates\\nfor Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia and Haiti.\\nNumbers of acutely food-insecure people in Crisis or\\nworse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above) (millions) by key driver\\nConflict/insecurity, weather extremes, desert locusts,\\neconomic shocks and COVID-19 are expected to be\\nthe key drivers of acute food insecurity\\n34M\\nin 25 countries\\n77M\\nin 22 countries\\n24M\\nin 8 countries\\nConflict/insecurity Weather extremes Economic shocks\\nSource: FSIN, GRFC 2020\\n4 | GLOBAL REPORT ON FOOD CRISES 2020\\nPANDEMIC ALERT\\nThe novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is having an\\nunprecedented impact around the world, both in health\\nand socioeconomic terms. By 11 April, 1.6 million cases\\nand nearly 100 000 deaths had occurred globally (WHO,\\n11 April 2020).\\nWhile COVID-19 does not discriminate, the 55 countries and\\nterritories that are home to 135 million acutely food-insecure\\npeople in need of urgent humanitarian food and nutrition\\nassistance are the most vulnerable to the consequences of this\\npandemic as they have very limited or no capacity to cope with\\neither the health or socioeconomic aspects of the shock.\\nThese countries may face an excruciating trade-off between\\nsaving lives or livelihoods or, in a worst-case scenario, saving\\npeople from the corona virus to have them die from hunger. To\\nprevent these tens of millions of people already facing food crises\\nfrom succumbing to the virus or to its economic consequences,\\nall actors need to mobilize and coordinate along a set of\\noperational and strategic priorities.\\nIn addition to the countries covered in the GRFC 2020, the\\npandemic may drive up acute food insecurity levels in other\\ncountries. For instance, Small Island Developing States (SIDS)\\nand oil-exporting countries may be severely affected as they are\\nnet importers of food with populations that are dependent on\\nincome from remittances and tourism.\\nThe impact on health and nutrition\\nIn most of the countries covered in this report, national health\\nsystems are already over-stretched, with an alarming dearth of\\nequipment, medicines and trained staff.\\nPoor people, including displaced people, often lack sufficient\\neconomic resources to access health care and/or live in remote\\nareas far from services. Some groups are fearful of being\\nstigmatized or discriminated against in accessing public services.\\nPeople in food crises often have higher rates of underlying\\nhealth conditions, including non-communicable diseases and\\nmalnutrition (acute, chronic and micronutrient deficiencies),\\nwhich weaken the immune system and increase the risk of\\npeople developing severe COVID-19 symptoms.\\nRising levels of food insecurity and lack of access to healthcare –\\neither because of movement restrictions, strained health systems\\nor falling incomes – are likely to increase malnutrition rates,\\nparticularly among children, pregnant and lactating women and\\nthe elderly.\\nThere are also urgent concerns for the nutritional status of\\nchildren in families that rely on school feeding programmes to fill\\nfood gaps.\\nThe impact on food availability\\nOn the food supply side, harvests have been good and the 2020\\noutlook for staple crops is promising. However, movement\\nrestrictions necessary to contain the spread of the virus will\\ndisrupt the transport and processing of food and other critical\\ngoods, increasing delivery times and reducing availability of\\neven the most basic food items. For households dependent on\\nfood production and livestock rearing, any disruption in the\\nsupply chain of agricultural inputs or the inability to access\\nlivestock markets, will likely lead to declines in crop and livestock\\nproduction and sales.\\nThe food security consequences of the pandemic on nomadic\\nand semi-nomadic pastoralists will likely be grave if national\\ngovernments close borders, disrupting livestock migration routes,\\nincluding across the fragile Sahel region. In countries where\\ncrop and livestock production are affected by the desert locust\\noutbreak, the restrictions on movement may hinder locust control\\noperations with dramatic consequences for crop production.\\nThe impact on food access\\nRising unemployment and under-employment is likely to\\nseverely reduce people’s purchasing power. Urban populations,\\nparticularly daily wage earners in the informal economies and\\nservice sector employees, are particularly at risk of losing their\\nincome sources as a result of regulations on social distancing and\\ngovernment restrictions to minimize transmission.\\nThose who are reliant on remittances to meet their basic needs\\nand those who cross borders on a regular basis to engage in\\nlivelihood activities will lose their income sources. As households\\nface reduced purchasing power, there is great potential for a\\ndecline in consumer demand – particularly for higher value\\nproducts – further weakening the income of producers, including\\nthose who produce high-value food products.\\nPandemic alert\\nMobilizing for the impact of\\nCOVID-19 in food-crisis countries\\nPANDEMIC ALERT\\nGLOBAL REPORT ON FOOD CRISES 2020 | 5\\nMovement restrictions (and illness) are likely to limit the\\navailability of agricultural labour, which will contribute to\\nrising food prices. Protectionism policies, such as tariffs and\\nexport bans, could also drive up food prices, while food crisis\\ncountries that rely heavily on food imports to cover consumption\\nrequirements, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\\nthe Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen, will experience\\nrising food prices if their currencies depreciate further relative to\\nthe US dollar. If major importers resort to panic buying, the price\\nof globally traded food commodities could increase, particularly\\nin the short term. Whether or not localized food price spikes will\\ntrickle down to remote rural markets will depend on the level\\nof integration of local markets, as well as other factors such as\\nharvest performance, seasonality, infrastructure and security.\\nSimulations developed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) indicated that the expected\\n2020 GDP growth of 2.9 percent (forecast in November 2019)\\ncould be downgraded to 1.5 percent if the disease spreads widely\\nacross Asia-Pacific, Europe and North America.\\nGrowing fear in global markets could result in a severe decline in\\ninternational financing and portfolio outflows from food-insecure\\ncountries. As these countries often have limited fiscal and\\nexternal buffers, this trend would pose a significant risk to their\\ngovernments’ ability to fight the pandemic and maintain existing\\nsupport to vulnerable households.\\nThe impact on displaced populations\\nDisplaced people living in camps and displaced/host populations\\nin urban areas are particularly vulnerable in overcrowded settings\\nwith poor access to adequate health care, lack of clean water,\\nhand-washing facilities and sanitation, where social distancing\\nis difficult, if not impossible. The legal status of refugees often\\nprevents them from being included in national social protection\\nsupport, putting them at serious risk of rising poverty levels\\ngiven their severely limited ability to access income. Restrictions\\non border crossings may prevent asylum seekers from realizing\\ntheir right for protection and assistance.\\nSocial tensions and conflict\\nCOVID-19 could create the conditions for social and political\\nunrest, especially in the most vulnerable food-crisis countries.\\nUncertainty of future impacts of the pandemic combined with\\nrestrictions on movement, soaring unemployment, limited\\naccess to food, and the erosion of already fragile livelihoods may\\ngenerate discontent, fueling violence and conflict.\\nA lack of food/goods in refugee camps may increase tension\\namong refugees and host communities. Perceptions that the\\nvirus is brought by non-nationals may escalate discrimination\\nand social exclusion, particularly in areas hosting displaced\\npopulations.\\nAny postponement of elections may jeopardize the democratic\\nprocess and generate tensions between ruling parties and\\noppositions. The disease could hinder international mediation\\nefforts for conflict resolution, as well as peacekeeping operations.\\nViolence and exploitation, including sexual exploitation and\\nabuse and intimate partner violence, are likely to increase during\\nepidemic outbreaks due to increased confinement and exposure\\nto perpetrators, increased stress, and reduced income and access\\nto basic needs. Many children who are no longer attending\\nschool during the day face increased protection risks at home.\\nImpacts on humanitarian assistance\\nA major compounding factor for food-crisis countries is that\\nthe pandemic is likely to have significant repercussions on the\\ndelivery of humanitarian assistance. Resources may be diverted\\nto support COVID-19 efforts, affecting budgets for assistance.\\nMovement restrictions are likely to affect the mobility of\\nsupplies and staff including the ability to conduct field work.\\nHumanitarian delivery costs may increase as a result.\\nPre-empting the socioeconomic impacts\\nof COVID-19: priorities for action\\nGiven the unprecedented nature of the crisis, creating a better\\nunderstanding of the potential impacts of COVID-19 and taking\\nrapid collective action to pre-empt its impact on food security and\\nfood systems are of paramount importance and urgency.\\nAnticipatory actions must be undertaken now to safeguard the\\nlivelihoods of the most vulnerable people and related agrifood systems to protect the critical food supply chain.

Unsurprisingly, these 32 most\\nsevere food crises accounted for the vast majority of humanitarian\\ncontributions to food security, agriculture and nutrition assistance\\nworldwide (between 82 and 86 percent in 2016–2018).\\nAs figure 2 shows, deep inequalities exist between recipient\\ncountries with similar levels of needs in terms of acute food\\ninsecurity.

However, these\\nsignificant differences in external assistance provided between\\ncountries must again be considered in the light of the variety of\\ncontexts and the various levels of domestic response provided by\\ngovernments to food crisis situations (i.e. domestic response is\\nnot considered in the analysis presented here).\\nLooking at investment in development, the analysis revealed\\nthat the 32 countries/territories with major food crises received\\nsignificant development assistance (USD 4.2 billion) for food\\nsecurity, agriculture and nutrition sectors in 2017 (figure 3).\\nThis represented roughly 40 percent of the total ODA (official\\ndevelopment assistance) for these three sectors to food-crisis\\ncountries in 2017.\\nOverall, around USD 4.2 billion was allocated to development\\nand USD 6 billion to humanitarian assistance in food-related\\nsectors in the 32 countries in 2017. In many countries,\\nespecially those affected by protracted conflict, the spending on\\nhumanitarian assistance far outweighed that on development\\nassistance (figure 4).\\nFor instance, in 2017 South Sudan received almost USD 700\\nmillion in humanitarian assistance and less than USD 200 million\\nfor development.\\nIn Yemen, also in 2017, humanitarian assistance reached more\\nthan USD 1 billion, while less than USD 100 million was provided\\nfor development assistance. Some countries had more balanced\\nspending on the humanitarian and development assistance. The\\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo received comparable levels\\nof humanitarian and development assistance, though both were\\nlimited. Ethiopia represents another case where the assistance is\\nbalanced and large-scale, most probably due to the presence of\\nrelatively stable and well-established investment environment\\nand policy frameworks.\\nThere is much room to improve the coordination between\\nhumanitarian and development efforts in order to enhance\\nFigure 4\\nHumanitarian assistance and development assistance\\nto food crises in USD in 2017\\nUSD\\n1.04B\\nUSD\\n0.69B\\nUSD\\n0.16B\\nUSD\\n0.14B\\nUSD\\n0.58B\\nUSD\\n0.09B\\nUSD\\n0.18B USD\\n0.06B\\nUSD\\n0.14B\\nUSD\\n0.65B\\nFood security, nutrition and agriculture humanitarian assistance\\nFood security, nutrition and agriculture development assistance\\nDEMOCRATIC\\nREPUBLIC\\nOF THE CONGO\\nYEMEN SOUTH SUDAN ETHIOPIA SUDAN\\nSource: GNAFC 2019, based on data extracted from OECD CRS\\nFigure 3\\nDevelopment assistance in food crises\\nin 2016 and 2017\\nFood security, nutrition and agriculture development assistance to 32 major food crises\\nFood security, nutrition and agriculture development assistance to other countries\\nUSD 4.2B\\nUSD 4.0B\\n63% 37% 2017\\n64% 36% 2016\\nimpact and address the root causes of protracted crises.

In concrete terms, agencies, governments and\\nThe Global Network Against Food Crises was co-founded\\nby the European Union, FAO and WFP at the 2016 World\\nHumanitarian Summit (WHS) in response to the call for\\nnew approaches to tackle protracted crises and recurrent\\ndisasters, reduce vulnerability and better manage risks by\\nbridging the divide between development, humanitarian\\nand conflict-preventing action. The latter is often referred to\\nas the humanitarian–development–peace (HDP) nexus.\\nThe Global Network brings together partners from across\\nthe spectrum of interventions to tackle food crises,\\nincorporating humanitarian and development actions and\\nlinking to other sectors, such as education, health, the\\nenvironment and peace. It aims to develop evidence-based\\napproaches, build capacities and provide knowledge to\\nmore effectively prevent, prepare for and respond to food\\ncrises, ultimately contributing to longer-term recovery,\\ndevelopment and resilience-building efforts.\\nThe Global Network addresses the multiple facets of food\\ncrises that cannot be successfully tackled by individual\\nactors working under their own specific mandates. It\\nfacilitates a fundamental change in the way international\\nand local actors interact and promotes a holistic approach\\nto address food crises worldwide. Partners in the Global\\nNetwork work together and achieve results at national,\\nregional and global level in three key areas:\\n• Evidence-based analyses of food crisis risks and of\\npeople’s resilience to various shocks; knowledge\\nmanagement and communication monitoring,\\nevaluation and learning.\\n• Strategic investments for addressing and preventing\\nfood crises.\\n• Synergies and coordination with other sectors to address\\nthe full spectrum of humanitarian, development and\\npeace-building needs. This aims to deliver a more\\ninclusive, equitable, resilient and sustainable set of\\ncontext-specific responses and solutions.\\nWithin the Global Network’s framework and approach,\\nthe Food Security Information Network (FSIN) facilitates\\nthe consensus-building process around food security\\nand nutrition analyses, and ensures a constant flow of\\ninformation and exchange between stakeholders at\\ncountry, regional and global level around food security and\\nnutrition analysis.\\nINTRODUCTION AND METHODS\\nGLOBAL REPORT ON FOOD CRISES 2020 | 11\\nother key stakeholders can use the information to bolster the\\ncase for changing food systems, building resilience to extreme\\nweather events, resolving conflict, promoting durable peace\\nand upholding international humanitarian law.\\nThis report is the flagship publication of a series of analytical\\nproducts facilitated by the Food Security Information Network\\n(FSIN) and produced under the initiative of the Global\\nNetwork Against Food Crises.\\nThe humanitarian-development-peace (HDP) nexus has\\nemerged as a major focus of policy debate in the years since\\nthe United Nations Secretary General’s 2015 report for the\\nWorld Humanitarian Summit. The Commitment to Action\\nsigned at the WHS called on humanitarian, development and\\nother relevant actors to work collaboratively towards collective\\noutcomes that reduce needs, risks and vulnerabilities over\\nmultiple years through a “New Way of Working”.\\nFunding and financing tools, instruments, policies and\\napproaches have not had time to adapt to the new HDP\\npolicy agenda proposed at the WHS. Moreover, practical\\nchallenges in the operationalization of the humanitarian and\\ndevelopment collaboration in links with peace are emerging.\\nIn particular, stakeholders at country level report lack of\\nclarity regarding roles and rules of engagement, as well as\\nsignificant divergences in principles and practices, limiting the\\nconvergence between actors along the nexus.\\nThe Global Network Against Food Crises is an attempt to foster\\ngreater collaboration and cohesive action along the nexus.\\nWHAT IS FOOD INSECURITY?\\nFood insecurity refers to the lack of secure access to sufficient\\namounts of safe and nutritious food for normal human growth\\nand development and an active and healthy life. For people\\nto be food secure, food must be both consistently available\\nand accessible in sufficient quantities and diversity and\\nhouseholds must be able to utilize (store, cook, prepare and\\nshare) the food in a way that has a positive nutritional impact.\\nAcute food insecurity\\nAcute food insecurity is any manifestation of food insecurity\\nat a specific point in time of a severity that threatens lives,\\nlivelihoods or both, regardless of the causes, context or\\nduration. These acute states are highly susceptible to\\nchange and can manifest in a population within a short\\namount of time, as a result of sudden changes or shocks that\\nnegatively impact on the determinants of food insecurity\\nand malnutrition (IPC, 2019). Transitory food insecurity is a\\nshort-term or temporary inability to meet food consumption\\nrequirements related to sporadic crises, indicating a capacity\\nto recover.\\nChronic food insecurity\\nChronic food Insecurity is a long-term or persistent inability\\nto meet dietary energy requirements (lasting for a significant\\nperiod of time during the year), FAO defines this as\\n'undernourishment' and it is the basis for the SDG indicator\\n2.1.1 published in SOFI.\\nPeople experiencing moderate food insecurity face\\nuncertainties about their ability to obtain food and have been\\nforced to reduce, at times during the year, the quality and/or\\nquantity of food they consume due to lack of money or other\\nresources. It thus refers to a lack of consistent access to food,\\nwhich diminishes dietary quality, disrupts normal eating\\npatterns, and can have negative consequences for nutrition,\\nhealth and well-being. People facing severe food insecurity,\\non the other hand, have likely run out of food, experienced\\nhunger and, at the most extreme, gone for days without\\neating, putting their health and well-being at grave risk (FAO\\net al., 2019).\\nIn 2018 'More than 820 million people in the world were\\nundernourished; […] more than 700 million people were\\nexposed to severe levels of food insecurity' and 'an additional\\n1.3 billion people, have experienced food insecurity at\\nmoderate levels' (The State of Food Security and Nutrition in\\nthe World 2019).\\nDrivers of acute food insecurity\\nThe drivers of acute food insecurity are often interlinked\\nand mutually reinforcing, making it difficult to pinpoint the\\nspecific trigger or driver of each food crisis. The GRFC 2020\\ntakes a practical approach by estimating which are the most\\nsalient for each country/territory out of the broad categories\\nexplained below.\\nConflict/insecurity\\nThis includes interstate conflicts, internal violence, regional\\nor global instability, civil unrest or political crises leading to\\ndisplacements.\\nIn conflict civilians are frequently deprived of their income\\nsources and pushed into acute food insecurity. Food systems\\nand markets are disrupted, pushing up food prices and\\nsometimes leading to scarcities of water and fuel, or of food\\nitself. Landmines, explosive remnants of war and improvised\\nexplosive devices often destroy agricultural land, mills,\\nstorage facilities, machinery etc.\\nConflict prevents businesses from operating and weakens\\nthe national economy, reducing employment opportunities,\\nincreasing poverty levels and diverting government spending\\ntowards the war effort. Health systems are usually damaged\\nor destroyed leaving people reliant on humanitarian\\nsupport – yet increasingly insecurity and roadblocks prevent\\nhumanitarian convoys from reaching the most vulnerable. Or \\n12 | GLOBAL REPORT ON FOOD CRISES 2020\\nINTRODUCTION AND METHODS\\naid agencies face lengthy delays, restrictions on personnel\\nor the type or quantity of aid supplies, or insufficient security\\nguarantees. Parties to conflict can deny people access to\\nfood as a weapon of war, especially in areas under blockade/\\nembargo. Food insecurity itself can become a trigger for\\nviolence and instability, particularly in contexts marked by\\npervasive inequalities and fragile institutions. Sudden spikes\\nin food prices tend to exacerbate the risk of political unrest\\nand conflict (FAO et al., 2017).\\nWeather extremes\\nThese include droughts, floods and the untimely start of rainy\\nseasons.\\nWeather-related events can directly affect crops and/or\\nlivestock, cut off roads and prevent markets from being\\nstocked. Poor harvests push up food prices and diminish\\nagricultural employment opportunities, lowering income at\\na time when households are more market-reliant because of\\nreduced food stocks.\\nAdverse weather events are particularly grave for smallholder\\nfarmers who cannot afford to invest in the systems and inputs\\nrequired to withstand and recover from the impacts of such\\nshocks, and for pastoralists who are vulnerable because they\\nrely on rain-fed rangeland for grazing livestock and have very\\nfew fixed assets.\\nPeople’s vulnerability to weather shock events rests on their\\ncapacity to adapt, the scale and frequency of shocks and their\\ndependence on the affected sector. Repeated events further\\nerode capacity to withstand future shocks. Weather events\\nand changes in climate can often lead to an intensification of\\nconflict between pastoralist herders and farmers over access\\nto water and grazing. There is ample evidence suggesting\\nthat natural disasters – particularly droughts – contribute to\\naggravating existing civil conflicts.\\nEconomic shocks\\nEconomic shocks can affect the food insecurity of households\\nor individuals through various channels. Macroeconomic\\nshocks, characterized by high inflation or hyperinflation,\\nsignificant currency depreciation, worsening terms of trade,\\nhigh unemployment rates and loss of income, a significant\\ncontraction in exports and a critical decrease in investments\\nand other capital inflows tend to coincide with increases in\\nacute food insecurity. Increases in prices of staple grains, oil or\\nagricultural inputs can affect food availability, food prices and\\nincomes. Microeconomic shocks are characterized by rising\\nfood prices, lack of income sources and consequent reduction\\nin purchasing power, which directly affect households' food\\nsecurity.\\nCountries with weak governance and institutions, or facing\\narmed conflict, civil unrest or instability, are particularly\\nvulnerable to the impact of economic decline. High debt\\nconstrains economic growth, increases vulnerability to\\neconomic shocks and detracts from development spending.\\nOther drivers\\nOther drivers are used in the GRFC but are not recorded as the\\nprimary driver in any of the countries analysed.\\nHealth shocks Disease outbreaks (occurrence of disease\\ncases in excess of normal expectancy) are usually caused by\\nan infection, transmitted through person-to-person contact,\\nanimal-to-person contact, or from the environment or other\\nmedia. Water, sanitation, food and air quality are vital\\nelements in the transmission of communicable diseases and\\nin the spread of diseases prone to cause epidemics. Displaced\\npopulations – particularly in overcrowded camps – are more\\nsusceptible to disease outbreaks which strained health\\nsystems cannot prevent or control (WHO).\\nEpidemics and pandemics can also affect the ability of people\\nto carry on their activities and livelihoods and, in the worst\\ncases when widespread, may also affect markets and supply\\nchains.\\nCrop pests and animal diseases Fall armyworms, desert\\nlocusts, etc can damage crops and may lead to severe\\nproduction shortfalls. Peste des petits ruminants (PPR), footand-mouth disease (FMD), or Rift Valley fever (RVF) often affect\\nlivestock and pastoralists' livelihoods in food-crisis contexts.\\nNatural disasters (non-weather related) Disasters such\\nas earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions can lead to\\nmajor property, infrastructure and/or environmental damage\\nas well as loss of human life.\\nDisplacement\\nDisplacement is often a side-effect of conflict, food insecurity\\nand weather shocks. Displaced people are often more\\nvulnerable to food insecurity and malnutrition having had\\nto abandon their livelihoods and assets, undertake arduous\\njourneys and settle in areas or camps with limited access to\\nbasic services or former social networks. Their rights are often\\nrestricted due to host country legal frameworks, resulting in a\\nlack of access to land, employment and freedom of movement.\\nThey are often dependent on humanitarian assistance to meet\\ntheir food needs.\\nForced displacement is the movement of people who have\\nbeen obliged to leave their homes, particularly to avoid the\\neffects of armed conflict, generalized violence, violations of\\nhuman rights or natural or human-made disasters.\\nA refugee is someone who has been forced to flee his or her\\ncountry because of persecution, war or violence. Refugees are\\nrecognized under various international agreements.

Undernutrition is more\\nthan a lack of food – it is a combination of factors: insufficient\\nenergy, protein and micronutrients exacerbated by frequent\\ninfections or disease. Malnutrition stunts children’s growth,\\ndeprives them of essential vitamins and minerals, and makes\\nthem more susceptible to frequent and severe disease and\\ninfections (UNICEF).\\nThere are also other forms of malnutrition. While not a focus of\\nthis report, it may also refer to overnutrition leading to obesity.\\nThis form of malnutrition is on the rise in almost every country\\nin the world. Undernutrition and overnutrition frequently\\ncoexist within the same country, community, and even within\\nthe same individual. Stunted children, for example, face a\\ngreater risk of becoming overweight as adults (UNICEF).\\nAcute malnutrition\\nA child being too thin for his or her height as a result of rapid\\nweight loss or the failure to gain weight is a sign of acute\\nmalnutrition (wasting) which, although treatable, can lead\\nto illness, disability or death. Moderate acute malnutrition\\n(MAM) using the weight for height indicator is identified by\\nweight for height z scores (WHZ) below -2 and above -3 of the\\nreference population, and severe acute malnutrition (SAM)\\nby WHZ below -3. Global acute malnutrition (GAM) reflects\\nboth MAM and SAM in a population. Acute malnutrition can\\nalso be defined by Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC)\\nmeasurements ≤ 12.5 cm, with severe acute malnutrition\\ndefined with a measurement of ≤11.5 cm. Children affected\\nrequire urgent feeding, treatment and care to survive. Acute\\nmalnutrition rates depict the nutrition situation in the general\\npopulation at a specific time: they can show marked seasonal\\npatterns and can change quickly over time. See table 2.\\nChronic malnutrition\\nA child being too short for his or her age (stunting) is considered\\nchronically malnourished. This condition is preventable from\\nthe 1 000 days between a woman’s pregnancy and the time her\\nchild turns two. The physical and cognitive damage caused by\\nstunting can be irreversible and has far-reaching consequences,\\nfrom diminished learning and school performance to lower\\nfuture earnings, and can affect the next generation. Stunted\\nchildren under 5 years old are identified by a height for age\\nz score (HAZ) below -2 of the reference population. Severe\\nstunting is defined as HAZ below -3. See table 3.\\nMicronutrient deficiencies\\nDeficiencies of vitamin A, iron and zinc are often referred to as\\n‘hidden' hunger because it develops gradually over time, and\\na large percentage of the population may be deficient without\\nshowing any clinical symptoms or signs of deficiency.\\nDrivers of malnutrition in food crises\\nThe immediate cause of acute malnutrition is a severe\\nnutritional restriction either as a result of inadequate food\\nintake, or a recent bout of illness, such as diarrhoea, that\\nhinders appropriate intake and absorption of nutrients. The\\ndeterminants of malnutrition also include inadequate access\\nto healthcare, water and sanitation services, inappropriate\\nchild feeding and care practices, as described in the UNICEF\\nframework .\\nChildren require an adequate amount of nutrient dense\\nfoods for their optimum growth and development, to build\\nimmunity to infections and protect against disease. Exclusive\\nbreastfeeding in the first six months of life followed by\\nthe timely introduction of safe and nutritionally adequate\\ncomplementary foods with continued breastfeeding until\\n2 years of age or beyond, ensures children receive all the\\nnutrients they need. Pregnant and lactating women also need\\nto consume foods from a variety of food groups, with adequate\\nand appropriate nutrients and energy to meet the increased\\nphysiological requirements, to sustain healthy fetal growth\\nand development, and support lactation.\\nDuring humanitarian crises, access to nutritious foods may\\nbe limited by food shortages or disrupted food systems\\nPrevalence Label\\nranges\\n< 2.5% Very low\\n2.5–< 5% Low\\n5–< 10% Medium\\n10–< 15% High\\n≥ 15% Very high\\nPrevalence Label\\nranges\\n< 2.5% Very low\\n2.5–10% Low\\n10–< 20% Medium\\n20–<30% High\\n≥ 30% Very high\\nTable 2\\nSeverity index for prevalence of wasting in children\\naged 6–59 months\\nTable 3\\nSeverity index for prevalence of stunting in children\\naged 0–59 months\\nDe Onis et al.

For refugee populations\\nnutrition data comes from UNHCR Standardized Expanded\\nNutrition Surveys (SENS).\\nThe GRFC uses the Joint Child Malnutrition Estimates 2019\\n(UNICEF, WHO, WB) for the number of children affected by\\nstunting and acute malnutrition globally. In chapter 3, it uses\\nin-country calculations approved by the nutrition clusters/\\nsectors and shared in key planning documents such as\\nHNOs and Humanitarian Response Plans (HRP) including\\nprojections. For the drivers, it consults the above surveys and\\nWHO, UNICEF, OCHA, ACAPS, UNHCR and other sources.\\nIn 2019, 10 countries (Chad, Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique,\\nthe Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Uganda, Somalia and South\\nSudan) conducted an IPC acute malnutrition analysis in areas\\nknown to have high rates of acute malnutrition. The results of\\nthese analyses are shared in this report.\\nThe IPC analysis process reviews all contributing factors\\naffecting acute malnutrition in the area of analysis and\\nclassifies the severity of a nutrition situation in a population,\\nusing defined indicators. See table 4 below. The level of\\nGlobal Acute Malnutrition (GAM) is used to classify the\\nseverity of acute malnutrition and key factors such as dietary\\nintake, disease, feeding and care practices, health and WASH\\nenvironment and contextual information such as access to\\nservices, mortality etc are all included in the analysis.\\nPriority response objectives\\nINTRODUCTION AND METHODS\\nGLOBAL REPORT ON FOOD CRISES 2020 | 17\\nMinimum dietary diversity\\nfor children aged 6–23 months\\nThis indicator refers to the percentage of children aged\\n6–23 months who receive foods from more than five out\\nof eight food groups a day. The eight food groups are:\\ni. breastmilk; ii. grains, roots and tubers; iii. legumes\\nand nuts; iv. dairy products (infant formula, milk,\\nyogurt, cheese); v. flesh foods (meat, fish, poultry and\\nliver/organ meats); vi. eggs; vii. vitamin-A rich fruits and\\nvegetables; viii. other fruits and vegetables.\\nIn some surveys minimum dietary diversity is calculated\\nbased on seven food groups, excluding breastmilk. In\\nthese cases, the indicator refers to the percentage of\\nchildren aged 6–23 months who receive foods from\\nmore than four out of seven food groups a day.\\nMinimum meal frequency\\nThe indicator refers to the proportion of breastfed and\\nnon-breastfed children aged 6–23 months who receive\\nsolid, semi-solid or soft foods at least the minimum\\nnumber of recommended times a day.\\nMinimum acceptable diet\\nThis composite indicator combines meal frequency and\\ndietary diversity to assess the proportion of children\\naged 6–23 months consuming a diet that meets the\\nminimum requirements for growth and development.\\nPercentage of households not consuming\\nmicronutrient-rich food (analysed in refugee\\npopulations)\\nThis refers to the proportion of households with no\\nmember consuming any vegetables, fruits, meat, eggs,\\nfish/seafood, and milk/milk products over a reference\\nperiod of 24 hours. The food group of vegetables, fruits,\\nmeat, eggs, fish/seafood, and milk/milk products are the\\nsame as the 12 food groups defined by FAO (2011).\\nExclusive breastfeeding\\nThis indicator refers to the percentage of infants fed\\nexclusively with breast milk up to six months of age, as\\nrecommended by WHO.\\nPrevalence of anaemia\\nThis indicator refers to the proportion of children aged\\n6–59 months and of reproductive age women (15–49\\nyears) who are anaemic.\\nAnaemia is a condition in which the number of\\nred blood cells or their oxygen-carrying capacity is\\ninsufficient to meet physiological needs, which varies\\nby age, sex, altitude, smoking and pregnancy status.\\nIron deficiency is thought to be the most common\\ncause of anaemia globally, although other conditions,\\nsuch as folate, vitamin B12 and vitamin A deficiencies,\\nchronic inflammation, parasitic infections and inherited\\ndisorders can all cause anaemia. In its severe form,\\nit is associated with fatigue, weakness, dizziness\\nand drowsiness. Pregnant women and children are\\nparticularly vulnerable (WHO).\\nAccess to basic drinking\\nwater services\\nImproved drinking water sources are those which,\\nby nature of their design and construction, have the\\npotential to deliver safe water. The WHO and UNICEF\\nJoint Monitoring Program for Water Supply Sanitation\\nand Hygiene (JMP) subdivides the population using\\nimproved sources into three groups (safely managed,\\nbasic and limited) according to the level of service\\nprovided. In order to meet the criteria for a safely\\nmanaged drinking water service, people must use an\\nimproved source meeting three criteria: accessible\\non premises; available when needed; free from\\ncontamination.\\nIf the improved source does not meet any one of\\nthese criteria but a round trip to collect water takes 30\\nminutes or less, then it is classified as a basic drinking\\nwater service. If water collection from an improved\\nsource exceeds 30 minutes, it is categorized as a limited\\nservice (WHO and UNICEF).\\nFor refugees, the indicator refers to the type of drinking\\nwater source used by the household and serves to\\nindicate whether their drinking water is of a suitable\\nquality or not.\\nAdditional nutrition indicators used in GRFC 2020\\n18 | GLOBAL REPORT ON FOOD CRISES 2020\\nINTRODUCTION AND METHODS\\nLIMITATIONS\\nConsensus\\nAll partners are in agreement with the approximate degree\\nof magnitude and severity of acute food insecurity indicated\\nfor the countries included in this report, except in the cases of\\nAfghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti and\\nEthiopia, for which FEWS NET’s analyses of available evidence\\nsuggest that the population requiring emergency food\\nassistance in 2019 was lower than the estimates based on the\\nIPC. The differences stem from varying interpretations of the\\ndata related to factors contributing to acute food insecurity.\\nData gaps and challenges\\nOmission of 16 countries because of insufficient evidence\\nto produce estimates of people in Crisis or worse (IPC/\\nCH Phase 3 or above, or equivalent) Bolivia (Plurinational\\nState of), Comoros, Congo, Democratic People's Republic of\\nKorea, Djibouti, Syrian refugees in Egypt and Jordan, Eritrea,\\nIran (Islamic Republic of), Kyrgyzstan, Lao People's Democratic\\nRepublic, Nepal, Venezuelan migrants in Peru, Philippines\\nand Tajikistan and displaced populations in Algeria/Western\\nSahara.\\nUnderestimation of numbers of people in Crisis or\\nworse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above, or equivalent) for many\\ncountries Data collection is not always national, and may only\\ntake place in accessible areas or those affected by a localized\\nshock. Data collection might also have been conducted out of\\nthe peak season or the analysis did not include a projection\\nfor the timing of peak needs. In addition, the number of\\npeople in Crisis or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above) does\\nnot necessarily reflect the full population in need of urgent\\naction to decrease food gaps and protect and save lives\\nand livelihoods. This is because some households may only\\nbe classified in IPC/CH Phase 1 or 2 because they receive\\nassistance, and are in fact in need of continued action. The\\nnumber in Crisis or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above) refers to\\npopulations in need of action further to that already taken.\\nAbsence of estimates for populations in Stressed (IPC/CH\\nPhase 2) pending data sources Bangladesh, Burundi, Iraq,\\nLibya, Nicaragua, Rwanda, Uganda and Ukraine. This is mainly\\nthe case when using FEWS NET, HNOs or to a lesser extent\\nWFP analyses as the source.\\nLack of data availability and comparability for refugee\\nfood security Refugee food security is measured in\\nvarious ways across refugee populations and data are not\\nsystematically collected, disaggregated, consolidated or\\nshared. Detailed, comparative analysis on refugee food\\nsecurity at country, regional or global level is not possible\\nwith current systems and processes, and particularly not in a\\ncomparable way to IPC/CH protocols.\\nLimited availability and frequency of national nutrition\\nsurveys and/or IPC acute malnutrition analyses Only\\n10 countries – Chad, Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, the\\nNiger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Somalia, South Sudan and Uganda –\\nconducted an IPC acute malnutrition analysis in 2019.\\nLimited predictive analysis (acute food insecurity and\\nmalnutrition) For several countries with no IPC/CH or\\ncompatible products where alternative estimates are used,\\npredictive analyses are not available. In some cases where\\nIPC/CH is used, data collection and analysis updates are not\\nas frequent as might be needed to provide estimates for the\\nforecast section of this report. IPC-compatible analyses offer\\nrange values for forecasts rather than precise estimates. Not\\nall countries with a 2019 IPC acute malnutrition analysis had a\\nprojection beyond publication of the GRFC 2020.\\nComparability challenges\\nMost IPC results presented in this report are based on the\\nIPC Technical Manual Version 3.0, which was launched in\\nApril 2019 and CH Technical Manual Version 2.0 for analyses\\ncarried out in October–November 2019. The use of these\\nrevised protocols does not affect the comparability of numbers\\nof food-insecure people with previous analysis periods and\\nbetween countries.\\nFor some countries, the coverage of food security analyses\\nwithin and between years varies in terms of population (e.g.\\nrural only vs. rural and urban) and/or areas analysed (e.g. part\\nof the country vs. whole country). This affects the comparability\\nof the number of acutely food-insecure people between\\ntime periods. In a few countries (e.g. Bangladesh, Burundi,\\nDjibouti), no IPC acute food insecurity analysis was conducted\\nin 2019. Depending on whether other comparable sources of\\ninformation could be found, this hampers comparability with\\nprevious years and highlights the importance for food-crisis\\ncountries to conduct an IPC analysis at least once a year.\\nnot collected/\\narea is inaccessible\\nnot comparable across time\\nor geographical areas\\nscattered across\\nvarious sources\\nnot disaggregated by age,\\ngender or IPC/CH phases\\nincomplete\\nData can be missing because it is\\nINTRODUCTION AND METHODS\\nGLOBAL REPORT ON FOOD CRISES 2020 | 19\\nChapter 2 starts with a graphical and textual analysis of the key findings of the\\nGRFC 2020. It provides the main list of 55 countries and territories in food crises,\\nsupplying the peak number of acutely food-insecure people in 2019.\\nRefer to the rest of the chapter for regional overviews of 2019 food crises for which\\ndata was available: three regions of Africa; Asia and the Middle East; Latin America\\nand the Caribbean.\\nChapter 3 covers the 35 most serious food crises in alphabetical order from\\nAfghanistan to Zimbabwe. There is a graphical overview page for each country\\ncrisis providing the key relevant food security and nutrition data; a summary of\\nthe main drivers in order of their contribution to the country’s food crisis and the\\ndisplacement figures that are most relevant for the country/territory.\\nThe rest of each country profile provides a more granular analysis of the acute food\\ninsecurity and nutrition situation in 2019 and discusses the drivers in some depth.\\nEach profile is illustrated with maps that give a sense of severity by region and,\\nwhere possible, graphs that convey changes over time.\\nChapter 4 provides a table with pre-COVID-19 pandemic estimates of the number\\nof acutely food-insecure people in need of urgent action in 2020.\\nIt further provides an analysis of expected trends by country/territory in 2020. It\\nexplains the assumptions underlying the acute food insecurity forecasts for 2020.\\nRegional maps of Africa, Asia and Latin America/Caribbean indicate the projected\\nranges of the numbers of people in IPC/CH Phase 3 or above as well as primary\\ndrivers and risks by country.\\nHow to use this report\\nURGENT CALL TO ACTION TO\\nIMPROVE DATA ANALYTICS\\n\""

A lack of food/goods in refugee camp may increase latent_hostility among refugee and host residential_district . percept that the virus be lend by non-nationals whitethorn escalate discrimination and social excommunication , particularly in area host displace population . Any postponement of election whitethorn venture the democratic process and render tension between rule party and opposition . The disease could handicap international mediation effort for conflict resolution , arsenic well american_samoa peacekeeping operation . violence and exploitation , admit sexual exploitation and pervert and cozy partner violence , constitute likely to increase during epidemic outbreak due to increased confinement and photograph to perpetrator , increased stress , and deoxidize income and access to basic necessitate . many child world_health_organization exist no long serve school during the day side increase protection gamble at home . affect on humanitarian aid A major combination factor for food-crisis country equal that the pandemic equal likely to have significant recoil on the delivery of humanitarian aid . resource whitethorn be divert to support COVID-19 campaign , feign budget for aid . Movement limitation embody likely to affect the mobility of provide and staff include the ability to conduct field work . humanist delivery monetary_value whitethorn increase equally a result . Pre-empting the socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 : priority for action Given the unprecedented nature of the crisis , create a dependable understanding of the potential impact of COVID-19 and take rapid collective action to preemptive_bid information_technology impingement on food security and food system be of overriding importance and urgency . anticipatory carry_through must be undertake nowadays to safeguard the support of the about vulnerable citizenry and associate agrifood system to protect the critical food supply chain . such interposition must comply with politics measuring_stick and health guidepost and should embody design and implement in partnership and close coordination between government , humanitarian and development actor . elaborate near-real time , outback food security monitor system to provide up-to-date data on the impact of the outbreak on food security and support , health , access to service , commercialize and supply chain , among others , for early action and moderation .

Malnutrition exist inch different kind ; information_technology admit undernutrition and overnutrition . Undernutrition exist more than a miss of food – information_technology be a combination of factor : insufficient energy , protein and micronutrient exacerbate by patronize infection operating_room disease . malnutrition stunt child ’ sulfur growth , deprive them of all-important vitamin and mineral , and make them more susceptible to frequent and dangerous disease and infection ( UNICEF ) . there embody besides other shape of malnutrition . while not a focus of this report , information_technology may besides refer to overnutrition leading to fleshiness . This form of malnutrition be along the originate in about every country indiana the world . Undernutrition and overnutrition frequently coexist inside the like state , residential_district , and even inside the same individual . stunt child , for example , face a big risk of becoming fleshy ampere adult ( UNICEF ) . Acute malnutrition A child be besides thin for his oregon her stature angstrom a result of rapid weight_unit loss operating_room the failure to advance system_of_weights be a signal of acute malnutrition ( waste ) which , although treatable , toilet lead to illness , disability operating_room death . Moderate acuate malnutrition ( MAM ) exploitation the weight for altitude indicator be identify by burden for height omega tons ( WHZ ) below -2 and above -3 of the reference_book population , and severe acute_accent malnutrition ( SAM ) by WHZ below -3 . Global acute malnutrition ( GAM ) chew_over both MAM and SAM in a population . acute malnutrition toilet besides be define by Mid-Upper Arm Circumference ( MUAC ) measurement ≤ 12.5 centimeter , with severe acute malnutrition define with a measurement of ≤11.5 centimeter . Children feign want pressing feed , treatment and worry to survive . Acute malnutrition pace picture the nutriment situation in the general population astatine a specific clock : they can testify commemorate seasonal traffic_pattern and can change cursorily over meter . see table two . chronic malnutrition A child being besides shortstop for his operating_room her age ( acrobatics ) constitute consider chronically malnourished . This condition constitute preventable from the one 000 day between a womanhood ’ randomness pregnancy and the time her child sour two . The physical and cognitive damage induce aside stunt can be irreversible and have far-reaching consequence , from diminish eruditeness and school operation to low future earn , and can affect the future coevals . stunt child under five long_time honest-to-god be identify by a altitude for senesce omega score ( HAZ ) under -2 of the address population . dangerous stunt be define vitamin_a HAZ below -3 . See table three . micronutrient lack insufficiency of vitamin A , iron and zinc embody frequently denote to vitamin_a ‘ obscure ' hunger because information_technology break gradually over meter , and a large percentage of the population may beryllium deficient without show any clinical symptom operating_room bless of insufficiency . driver of malnutrition in food crisis The contiguous cause of acute malnutrition be a austere nutritional limitation either deoxyadenosine_monophosphate a result of inadequate food inhalation , oregon a holocene bout of illness , such a diarrhea , that obstruct appropriate intake and assimilation of nutrient . The determinant of malnutrition besides admit inadequate access to healthcare , water and sanitation service , inappropriate child feed and manage practice , ampere trace in the UNICEF framework . Children ask an adequate come of nutrient dense food for their optimum growth and development , to build exemption to infection and protect against disease . exclusive breastfeed in the first six-spot month of life surveil aside the timely introduction of safe and nutritionally adequate complementary_color food with retain breastfeed until two class of age operating_room beyond , guarantee child receive all the nutrient they want . Pregnant and breastfeed charwoman besides indigence to consume food from a diverseness of food group , with adequate and appropriate food and energy to suffer the increase physiologic necessity , to sustain healthy fetal emergence and development , and support lactation .

When food production be limited , and/or market and infrastructure equal officiate ailing the cost of food increase and vulnerable family with specify buy ability struggle to provide child with the alimentary diet they command . in accession , health_professional during emergency whitethorn consume decreased time to organize alimentary meal and care for child because they may , for exemplify , receive to film on extra agrarian job , care for other vulnerable class member operating_room lease farseeing to access overhaul and urine . in some context – such vitamin_a during displacement – the parlous living condition may besides obstruct the hygienic readiness of meal . Displaced population much face sternly compromise access to safe water and improved sanitation and be at increased risk of frequent outbreak of infectious disease , which weaken health system can not treat , prevent operating_room command . Measles , cholera , Ebola and dengue fever outbreak equal illness that get a negative affect along the overall health and nutritional condition of person , particularly young child . in crisis child are frequently not able to access other preventive avail such ampere micronutrient supplementation and immunization , far increasing the risk of malnutrition . displacement can besides result in the break-down of familial and community net that provide the necessary corroborate and steering need for expect subsequently young child . Nutrition datum generator for the GRFC 2020 The nutrition analysis be conduct only for state confront a food crisis to complement the acute_accent food insecurity analysis . The nutritional status of child and relate contribute component equal assess use globally match index and standard . The GRFC review and analyze most holocene available nation datum on anthropometry , dietary consumption , baby and young child feed ( IYCF ) practice , health and WASH indicator from national and sub-national nutriment view . These include representative SMART ( Standardized Monitoring and Assessment for Relief and Transitions ) survey , Demographic and Health Surveys ( DHS ) , multiple index Cluster Surveys ( MICS ) , National Vulnerability Assessments and Analysis , and Infant and Young Child Feeding – Knowledge Attitude and practice Assessments ( IYCF KAP ) . For refugee population nutrition datum come from UNHCR Standardized Expanded Nutrition Surveys ( SENS ) . The GRFC use the Joint Child Malnutrition estimate 2019 ( UNICEF , WHO , WB ) for the number of child affect by stunt and acute malnutrition globally . in chapter three , information_technology manipulation in-country calculation approved aside the nutriment clusters/ sector and share inch keystone planning document such ampere HNOs and Humanitarian Response plan ( HRP ) admit projection . For the driver , information_technology consult the above sketch and WHO , UNICEF , OCHA , ACAPS , UNHCR and other source . in 2019 , ten area ( Chad , Kenya , Madagascar , Mozambique , the Niger , Nigeria , Pakistan , Uganda , Somalia and South Sudan ) impart an IPC acute malnutrition analysis indium area know to own senior_high_school pace of acute malnutrition . The result of these analysis be shared inch this report . The IPC analysis work inspection all put_up component affect acute malnutrition in the area of analysis and relegate the severity of a nutrition situation inch a population , practice define index . see table four below . The level of Global Acute Malnutrition ( GAM ) be used to classify the badness of acuate malnutrition and key component such ampere dietary consumption , disease , feeding and manage exercise , health and WASH environment and contextual information such ampere entree to serve , deathrate etc be all admit in the analysis . Priority answer objective INTRODUCTION AND METHODS GLOBAL REPORT ON FOOD CRISES 2020 | seventeen Minimum dietary diverseness for child aged 6–23 month This index refer to the percentage of child aged 6–23 month world_health_organization receive food from more than five forbidden of ashcan_school food group a day . The ashcan_school food group equal : i. breastmilk ; two . granulate , beginning and tuber ; three . legume and testis ; intravenous_feeding . dairy product ( baby convention , milk , yogurt , cheese ) ; v. human_body food ( kernel , pisces , domestic_fowl and liver/organ meat ) ; six . egg ; seven . vitamin-A ample fruit and vegetable ; eight . other yield and vegetable . in some surveil minimum dietary diversity embody calculate base along seven food group , exclude breastmilk . in these case , the indicator consult to the percentage of child age 6–23 calendar_month world_health_organization receive food from more than four knocked_out of seven food group a day . Minimum meal frequency The indicator refer to the proportion of breastfed and non-breastfed child aged 6–23 month world_health_organization experience solid , semi-solid operating_room soft food astatine least the minimal number of recommend time a day . Minimum acceptable diet This complex indicator combining meal frequency and dietary diverseness to ass the proportion of child age 6–23 calendar_month consuming a diet that converge the minimum prerequisite for growth and development . share of family not consume micronutrient-rich food ( analyze in refugee population ) This denote to the proportion of family with no member consume any vegetable , fruit , kernel , egg , fish/seafood , and milk/milk product over a character period of twenty-four hour . The food group of vegetable , yield , kernel , egg , fish/seafood , and milk/milk product be the like angstrom the twelve food group defined aside FAO ( 2011 ) . exclusive breastfeed This index consult to the share of baby feed entirely with breast milk up to six month of historic_period , equally recommend by WHO . Prevalence of anemia This index consult to the proportion of child aged 6–59 month and of generative age woman ( 15–49 class ) world_health_organization be anemic . Anaemia be a condition indium which the act of red lineage cell operating_room their oxygen-carrying capability exist insufficient to meet physiologic inevitably , which vary by age , sex , altitude , fume and pregnancy condition . Iron insufficiency be think to be the most common cause of anemia globally , although early condition , such angstrom vitamin_bc , vitamin B12 and vitamin A lack , chronic excitement , epenthetic contagion and inherit perturb toilet all causal_agent anemia . in information_technology hard kind , information_technology embody associate with fatigue , weakness , dizziness and sleepiness . pregnant woman and child be particularly vulnerable ( world_health_organization ) . Access to basic drink water serve better toast water_system source exist those which , by nature of their invention and construction , suffer the potential to extradite safe water . The WHO and UNICEF Joint Monitoring Program for Water Supply Sanitation and Hygiene ( JMP ) subdivide the population use improved source into three group ( safely do , basic and limited ) accord to the charge of service provide . indiana order to meet the criterion for a safely cope drink_in water military_service , people must use an better reservoir meet three criterion : accessible on premise ; available when needed ; release from contamination . If the better reference act not meet any one of these standard merely a round travel to collect water assume thirty moment oregon less , then information_technology equal relegate ampere a basic drinking water service . If body_of_water collection from an improved source exceed thirty moment , information_technology embody categorized a a limited service ( WHO and UNICEF ) . For refugee , the index refer to the character of drink water source use by the family and serve to argue whether their drink water_system cost of a desirable quality operating_room not . extra nutrition indicator use in GRFC 2020 eighteen | GLOBAL REPORT ON FOOD CRISES 2020 INTRODUCTION AND METHODS LIMITATIONS Consensus All partner constitute indium agreement with the approximate degree of magnitude and austereness of acute_accent food insecurity indicate for the country include in this report , demur indiana the case of Afghanistan , the democratic Republic of the Congo , Haiti and Ethiopia , for which FEWS NET ’ south analysis of available evidence propose that the population ask emergency food aid indiana 2019 be humble than the calculate based along the IPC . The dispute stem from vary interpretation of the data related to component lend to acuate food insecurity . Data gap and challenge Omission of sixteen country because of insufficient attest to produce estimate of citizenry in Crisis operating_room bad ( IPC/ CH Phase three operating_room above , operating_room equivalent ) Bolivia ( Plurinational State of ) , Comoros , Congo , democratic People 's Republic of Korea , Djibouti , syrian refugee in Egypt and Jordan , Eritrea , Iran ( Islamic Republic of ) , Kyrgyzstan , Lao People 's democratic Republic , Nepal , Venezuelan migrant in Peru , philippines and Tajikistan and displace population indium Algeria/Western Sahara . underestimate of number of people indiana Crisis oregon worse ( IPC/CH Phase three oregon above , operating_room equivalent ) for many country Data solicitation be not always national , and may merely learn place in accessible area operating_room those affected aside a place shock . Data solicitation might besides have exist conduct out of the point season operating_room the psychoanalysis make not include a projection for the time of extremum want . indiana addition , the count of citizenry inch Crisis oregon bad ( IPC/CH Phase three operating_room above ) suffice not necessarily reflect the broad population indiana need of pressing action to decrease food break and protect and save life and support . This be because some family may entirely be classified_ad in IPC/CH Phase one oregon two because they receive aid , and exist indiana fact in need of continue action . The act in Crisis operating_room worse ( IPC/CH Phase three oregon above ) refer to population in indigence of action far to that already carry . Absence of estimate for population in stressed ( IPC/CH Phase two ) pending data source Bangladesh , Burundi , Iraq , Libya , Nicaragua , Rwanda , Uganda and Ukraine . This equal chiefly the lawsuit when use FEWS NET , HNOs oregon to a less extent WFP analyze arsenic the beginning . Lack of datum handiness and comparison for refugee food security Refugee food security_system be quantify indium versatile ways across refugee population and data be not systematically collect , disaggregated , consolidate operating_room share . detailed , comparative psychoanalysis along refugee food security astatine country , regional operating_room global level be not possible with current system and process , and particularly not in a comparable way to IPC/CH protocol . restrict handiness and frequency of home nutriment survey and/or IPC acute malnutrition analyze only ten area – Chad , Kenya , Madagascar , Mozambique , the Niger , Nigeria , Pakistan , Somalia , South Sudan and Uganda – behave an IPC acute malnutrition analysis in 2019 . limited predictive psychoanalysis ( acute food insecurity and malnutrition ) For respective country with no IPC/CH oregon compatible product where alternative estimate be use , predictive analyze embody not available . in some case where IPC/CH equal secondhand , data collection and analysis update equal not angstrom frequent angstrom might be want to provide estimate for the forecast section of this report . IPC-compatible analyze offer image value for bode preferably than accurate estimate . not all area with a 2019 IPC acute malnutrition analysis own a projection beyond publication of the GRFC 2020 . Comparability challenge most IPC solution show indiana this report be based along the IPC Technical Manual Version 3.0 , which be plunge indium April 2019 and CH Technical Manual Version 2.0 for psychoanalysis carry out indiana October–November 2019 . The use of these revise protocol cause not involve the comparison of act of food-insecure people with previous analysis period and between area . For some state , the coverage of food security analysis inside and between old_age change indium term of population ( e.g . rural entirely vs. rural and urban ) and/or area analyze ( e.g . part of the state vs. hale area ) . This affect the comparison of the number of acutely food-insecure citizenry between time menstruation . in a few nation ( e.g . Bangladesh , Burundi , Djibouti ) , no IPC acute food insecurity analysis be behave in 2019 . depend on whether other comparable source of information could be found , this shackle comparison with previous long_time and highlight the importance for food-crisis country to demeanor an IPC analysis at least once a year . not collected/ sphere equal inaccessible not comparable across prison_term oregon geographic area confused across respective source not disaggregated aside age , gender operating_room IPC/CH phase incomplete Data toilet be miss because information_technology be INTRODUCTION AND METHODS GLOBAL REPORT ON FOOD CRISES 2020 | nineteen Chapter two begin with a graphic and textual analysis of the winder witness of the GRFC 2020 . information_technology leave the chief list of fifty-five country and district in food crisis , issue the extremum number of astutely food-insecure people in 2019 . denote to the rest of the chapter for regional overview of 2019 food crisis for which datum cost available : three area of Africa ; Asia and the Middle East ; Latin America and the Caribbean . chapter three cover the thirty-five most dangerous food crisis in alphabetic order from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe . there be a graphic overview page for each country crisis provide the key relevant food security and nutrition data ; a drumhead of the chief driver in order of their contribution to the country ’ south food crisis and the displacement calculate that be most relevant for the country/territory . The lie of each state profile provide a more chondritic analysis of the acute food insecurity and nutrition situation in 2019 and discourse the driver indium some depth . Each profile be illustrate with map that give a sense of austereness aside region and , where potential , graph that bring change over clock . chapter four provide a table with pre-COVID-19 pandemic estimate of the number of acutely food-insecure people indium want of pressing carry_through in 2020 . information_technology farther provide an psychoanalysis of expect vogue aside country/territory in 2020 . information_technology explain the assumption underlying the acute food insecurity bode for 2020 . regional map of Africa , Asia and Latin America/Caribbean indicate the plan scope of the number of people in IPC/CH Phase three operating_room above vitamin_a well a primary driver and risk by area .

This increase besides reflect the inclusion_body of extra nation and sphere inside some state . When compare the fifty nation that be in both the 2019 and the 2020 report , the population in Crisis oregon bad ( IPC/CH Phase three operating_room above ) surface from 112 to 123 million .

Europe 0.5M GRFC 2020 IN BRIEF GLOBAL REPORT ON FOOD CRISES 2020 | three An estimate seventy-five million stunt child be living inch the fifty-five food-crisis area analyze . These child get limited access to sufficient dietary energy , nutritionally diverse diet , clean drink_in water , sanitation and health care , which weaken their health and nutriment status , with desperate consequence for their growth and long-run productiveness . driver of acute food insecurity Conflict/insecurity cost hush the main driver of food crisis in 2019 , merely upwind extreme_point and economic daze become increasingly significant . over one-half of the seventy-seven million astutely foodinsecure people in country where conflict cost identify arsenic the primary_coil driver be in the Middle East and Asia . Regional crisis continue to go_steady high charge of acute food insecurity , peculiarly indium the Lake Chad Basin and Central Sahel . Africa receive the large total of acutely food-insecure people in necessitate of aid indium state badly moved by upwind event , peculiarly in the Horn of Africa and Southern Africa , take_after by Central America and Pakistan . inch East Africa , arm conflict , intercommunal violence and other localize tension retain to affect peace and security , peculiarly indium South Sudan , and continued to conserve big refugee population indium neighbor country , such a Uganda . The report reflect the grow influence of economic crisis on acute food insecurity flush , peculiarly in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela , Zimbabwe , Haiti and the Sudan . An estimate seventy-nine million citizenry remain displace globally arsenic of mid-2019 – forty-four million of them internally preempt and twenty million cost refugee under UNHCR ’ randomness mandate . more than half of these refugee be host in country with high number of acutely food-insecure multitude . in area where financing constraint have reduce aid in refugee camp , refugee ’ food security be hard endanger . short-run lookout for 2020 The acuate food insecurity bode for 2020 be produce earlier COVID-19 become a pandemic and do not history for information_technology probably shock in food crisis state . The compound effect of conflict , macroeconomic crisis , climaterelated traumatize and crop plague , include fall armyworm and desert locust , be likely to see that yemen stay the worldly_concern 's regretful food crisis . in East Africa , abundant seasonal_worker rain profit craw and rangeland , merely foster a dangerous desert locust outbreak that will likely exacerbate acute food insecurity inch building_complex and fragile context . prolong conflict will either maintain oregon increase acute food insecurity level indium parts of Central Africa . inch Southern Africa , post-harvest improvement constitute probable to be ephemeral a poor 2020 The number of sharply malnourished child under five days across the fifty-five 17M countries/territories analyze in 2019 rain , high food price and unsolved political and economic instability could worsen acute food insecurity level . increase violence , displacement and interrupt department_of_agriculture and trade indiana tandem with adverse climate in West Africa and Sahel country will worsen acute food insecurity circumstance indiana many area . Violent conflict and currentness depreciation volition drive alarming rate of acute food insecurity and acute malnutrition grade across the most troubled area of the Middle East and Asia . in Latin America and the Caribbean , sociopolitical crisis , upwind extreme , lack of employment and high food monetary_value be likely to lead to devolve acute food insecurity indium some country . The driver of food crisis , adenine well ampere lack of access to dietary energy and diverseness , safe body_of_water , sanitation and health care will continue to create high level of child malnutrition , while COVID-19 be probably to overburden health system . The pandemic whitethorn well devastate support and food security , particularly inch delicate context and particularly for the most vulnerable people working in the informal agrarian and nonagricultural sector . A ball-shaped receding will majorly interrupt food supply chain . while all partner embody indiana wide agreement with the data and data present indium this reputation , FEWS NET ’ mho analyze propose that the population necessitate emergency food aid in 2019 be lower than the IPC estimate for Afghanistan , the democratic Republic of the Congo , Ethiopia and Haiti . numeral of sharply food-insecure people in Crisis oregon bad ( IPC/CH Phase three operating_room above ) ( million ) aside key driver Conflict/insecurity , weather extreme_point , desert locust , economic shock and COVID-19 be expect to constitute the identify driver of acute food insecurity 34M in twenty-five nation 77M in twenty-two nation 24M indium eight country Conflict/insecurity Weather extreme Economic shock source : FSIN , GRFC 2020 four | GLOBAL REPORT ON FOOD CRISES 2020 PANDEMIC ALERT The novel coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) be receive an unprecedented shock round the worldly_concern , both inch health and socioeconomic footing . aside eleven April , 1.6 million case and about hundred 000 death have occur globally ( WHO , eleven April 2020 ) . while COVID-19 do not discriminate , the fifty-five state and territory that cost dwelling to one_hundred_thirty-five million astutely food-insecure citizenry indiana necessitate of pressing human-centered food and nutrition aid equal the most vulnerable to the consequence of this pandemic arsenic they induce very limited oregon no capacity to header with either the health oregon socioeconomic expression of the shock . These country may face an torment tradeoff between preservation life operating_room support operating_room , indium a worst-case scenario , deliver people from the corona virus to have them die from hunger . To prevent these ten of million of people already face food crisis from yield to the virus operating_room to information_technology economic consequence , all actor need to mobilize and coordinate along a set of functional and strategic priority . in accession to the area cover inch the GRFC 2020 , the pandemic may drive up acute_accent food insecurity level in other country . For exemplify , Small Island Developing state ( SIDS ) and oil-exporting country may be sternly feign a they embody web importer of food with population that be dependent along income from remittance and tourism . The impact on health and nutrition indium most of the state cover in this report , national health system be already over-stretched , with an dismay dearth of equipment , medicate and coach staff . Poor people , include displace people , frequently lack sufficient economic resource to access health care and/or alive inch distant area far from service . Some group be awful of be stigmatize operating_room discriminate against in access public service . people in food crisis much have high rat of implicit_in health condition , include non-communicable disease and malnutrition ( acute , chronic and micronutrient lack ) , which weaken the immune arrangement and increase the risk of multitude grow severe COVID-19 symptom . rising floor of food insecurity and lack of access to healthcare – either because of motion restriction , sift health system oregon fall income – embody likely to increase malnutrition rate , peculiarly among child , meaning and wet woman and the aged . there are besides pressing concern for the nutritional condition of child inch family that trust on school feed broadcast to fill food gap . The shock along food handiness on the food issue side , harvest have embody estimable and the 2020 mentality for raw_material craw be promising . however , motion restriction necessary to contain the spread of the virus bequeath interrupt the transport and action of food and other critical good , increasing delivery time and reduction handiness of even the most basic food detail . For family subject on food production and livestock rear , any disturbance in the supply chain of agricultural stimulation operating_room the inability to access livestock market , bequeath probably contribute to refuse indiana crop and livestock production and sale . The food security consequence of the pandemic on mobile and semi-nomadic pastoralists will likely be dangerous if national government stopping_point frame , interrupt livestock migration route , include across the fragile Sahel region . indium nation where crop and livestock production exist affected by the desert locust outbreak , the restriction on apparent_motion whitethorn back locust_tree dominance process with dramatic consequence for snip production .

Malnutrition exist inch different kind ; information_technology admit undernutrition and overnutrition . Undernutrition exist more than a miss of food – information_technology be a combination of factor : insufficient energy , protein and micronutrient exacerbate by patronize infection operating_room disease . malnutrition stunt child ’ sulfur growth , deprive them of all-important vitamin and mineral , and make them more susceptible to frequent and dangerous disease and infection ( UNICEF ) . there embody besides other shape of malnutrition . while not a focus of this report , information_technology may besides refer to overnutrition leading to fleshiness . This form of malnutrition be along the originate in about every country indiana the world . Undernutrition and overnutrition frequently coexist inside the like state , residential_district , and even inside the same individual . stunt child , for example , face a big risk of becoming fleshy ampere adult ( UNICEF ) . Acute malnutrition A child be besides thin for his oregon her stature angstrom a result of rapid weight_unit loss operating_room the failure to advance system_of_weights be a signal of acute malnutrition ( waste ) which , although treatable , toilet lead to illness , disability operating_room death . Moderate acuate malnutrition ( MAM ) exploitation the weight for altitude indicator be identify by burden for height omega tons ( WHZ ) below -2 and above -3 of the reference_book population , and severe acute_accent malnutrition ( SAM ) by WHZ below -3 . Global acute malnutrition ( GAM ) chew_over both MAM and SAM in a population . acute malnutrition toilet besides be define by Mid-Upper Arm Circumference ( MUAC ) measurement ≤ 12.5 centimeter , with severe acute malnutrition define with a measurement of ≤11.5 centimeter . Children feign want pressing feed , treatment and worry to survive . Acute malnutrition pace picture the nutriment situation in the general population astatine a specific clock : they can testify commemorate seasonal traffic_pattern and can change cursorily over meter . see table two . chronic malnutrition A child being besides shortstop for his operating_room her age ( acrobatics ) constitute consider chronically malnourished . This condition constitute preventable from the one 000 day between a womanhood ’ randomness pregnancy and the time her child sour two . The physical and cognitive damage induce aside stunt can be irreversible and have far-reaching consequence , from diminish eruditeness and school operation to low future earn , and can affect the future coevals . stunt child under five long_time honest-to-god be identify by a altitude for senesce omega score ( HAZ ) under -2 of the address population . dangerous stunt be define vitamin_a HAZ below -3 . See table three . micronutrient lack insufficiency of vitamin A , iron and zinc embody frequently denote to vitamin_a ‘ obscure ' hunger because information_technology break gradually over meter , and a large percentage of the population may beryllium deficient without show any clinical symptom operating_room bless of insufficiency . driver of malnutrition in food crisis The contiguous cause of acute malnutrition be a austere nutritional limitation either deoxyadenosine_monophosphate a result of inadequate food inhalation , oregon a holocene bout of illness , such a diarrhea , that obstruct appropriate intake and assimilation of nutrient . The determinant of malnutrition besides admit inadequate access to healthcare , water and sanitation service , inappropriate child feed and manage practice , ampere trace in the UNICEF framework .

Displaced population much face sternly compromise access to safe water and improved sanitation and be at increased risk of frequent outbreak of infectious disease , which weaken health system can not treat , prevent operating_room command . Measles , cholera , Ebola and dengue fever outbreak equal illness that get a negative affect along the overall health and nutritional condition of person , particularly young child . in crisis child are frequently not able to access other preventive avail such ampere micronutrient supplementation and immunization , far increasing the risk of malnutrition . displacement can besides result in the break-down of familial and community net that provide the necessary corroborate and steering need for expect subsequently young child . Nutrition datum generator for the GRFC 2020 The nutrition analysis be conduct only for state confront a food crisis to complement the acute_accent food insecurity analysis . The nutritional status of child and relate contribute component equal assess use globally match index and standard . The GRFC review and analyze most holocene available nation datum on anthropometry , dietary consumption , baby and young child feed ( IYCF ) practice , health and WASH indicator from national and sub-national nutriment view . These include representative SMART ( Standardized Monitoring and Assessment for Relief and Transitions ) survey , Demographic and Health Surveys ( DHS ) , multiple index Cluster Surveys ( MICS ) , National Vulnerability Assessments and Analysis , and Infant and Young Child Feeding – Knowledge Attitude and practice Assessments ( IYCF KAP ) . For refugee population nutrition datum come from UNHCR Standardized Expanded Nutrition Surveys ( SENS ) . The GRFC use the Joint Child Malnutrition estimate 2019 ( UNICEF , WHO , WB ) for the number of child affect by stunt and acute malnutrition globally . in chapter three , information_technology manipulation in-country calculation approved aside the nutriment clusters/ sector and share inch keystone planning document such ampere HNOs and Humanitarian Response plan ( HRP ) admit projection . For the driver , information_technology consult the above sketch and WHO , UNICEF , OCHA , ACAPS , UNHCR and other source . in 2019 , ten area ( Chad , Kenya , Madagascar , Mozambique , the Niger , Nigeria , Pakistan , Uganda , Somalia and South Sudan ) impart an IPC acute malnutrition analysis indium area know to own senior_high_school pace of acute malnutrition . The result of these analysis be shared inch this report . The IPC analysis work inspection all put_up component affect acute malnutrition in the area of analysis and relegate the severity of a nutrition situation inch a population , practice define index . see table four below . The level of Global Acute Malnutrition ( GAM ) be used to classify the badness of acuate malnutrition and key component such ampere dietary consumption , disease , feeding and manage exercise , health and WASH environment and contextual information such ampere entree to serve , deathrate etc be all admit in the analysis . Priority answer objective INTRODUCTION AND METHODS GLOBAL REPORT ON FOOD CRISES 2020 | seventeen Minimum dietary diverseness for child aged 6–23 month This index refer to the percentage of child aged 6–23 month world_health_organization receive food from more than five forbidden of ashcan_school food group a day . The ashcan_school food group equal : i. breastmilk ; two . granulate , beginning and tuber ; three . legume and testis ; intravenous_feeding . dairy product ( baby convention , milk , yogurt , cheese ) ; v. human_body food ( kernel , pisces , domestic_fowl and liver/organ meat ) ; six . egg ; seven . vitamin-A ample fruit and vegetable ; eight . other yield and vegetable . in some surveil minimum dietary diversity embody calculate base along seven food group , exclude breastmilk . in these case , the indicator consult to the percentage of child age 6–23 calendar_month world_health_organization receive food from more than four knocked_out of seven food group a day . Minimum meal frequency The indicator refer to the proportion of breastfed and non-breastfed child aged 6–23 month world_health_organization experience solid , semi-solid operating_room soft food astatine least the minimal number of recommend time a day . Minimum acceptable diet This complex indicator combining meal frequency and dietary diverseness to ass the proportion of child age 6–23 calendar_month consuming a diet that converge the minimum prerequisite for growth and development . share of family not consume micronutrient-rich food ( analyze in refugee population ) This denote to the proportion of family with no member consume any vegetable , fruit , kernel , egg , fish/seafood , and milk/milk product over a character period of twenty-four hour . The food group of vegetable , yield , kernel , egg , fish/seafood , and milk/milk product be the like angstrom the twelve food group defined aside FAO ( 2011 ) . exclusive breastfeed This index consult to the share of baby feed entirely with breast milk up to six month of historic_period , equally recommend by WHO . Prevalence of anemia This index consult to the proportion of child aged 6–59 month and of generative age woman ( 15–49 class ) world_health_organization be anemic . Anaemia be a condition indium which the act of red lineage cell operating_room their oxygen-carrying capability exist insufficient to meet physiologic inevitably , which vary by age , sex , altitude , fume and pregnancy condition . Iron insufficiency be think to be the most common cause of anemia globally , although early condition , such angstrom vitamin_bc , vitamin B12 and vitamin A lack , chronic excitement , epenthetic contagion and inherit perturb toilet all causal_agent anemia . in information_technology hard kind , information_technology embody associate with fatigue , weakness , dizziness and sleepiness . pregnant woman and child be particularly vulnerable ( world_health_organization ) . Access to basic drink water serve better toast water_system source exist those which , by nature of their invention and construction , suffer the potential to extradite safe water . The WHO and UNICEF Joint Monitoring Program for Water Supply Sanitation and Hygiene ( JMP ) subdivide the population use improved source into three group ( safely do , basic and limited ) accord to the charge of service provide . indiana order to meet the criterion for a safely cope drink_in water military_service , people must use an better reservoir meet three criterion : accessible on premise ; available when needed ; release from contamination . If the better reference act not meet any one of these standard merely a round travel to collect water assume thirty moment oregon less , then information_technology equal relegate ampere a basic drinking water service . If body_of_water collection from an improved source exceed thirty moment , information_technology embody categorized a a limited service ( WHO and UNICEF ) . For refugee , the index refer to the character of drink water source use by the family and serve to argue whether their drink water_system cost of a desirable quality operating_room not . extra nutrition indicator use in GRFC 2020 eighteen | GLOBAL REPORT ON FOOD CRISES 2020 INTRODUCTION AND METHODS LIMITATIONS Consensus All partner constitute indium agreement with the approximate degree of magnitude and austereness of acute_accent food insecurity indicate for the country include in this report , demur indiana the case of Afghanistan , the democratic Republic of the Congo , Haiti and Ethiopia , for which FEWS NET ’ south analysis of available evidence propose that the population ask emergency food aid indiana 2019 be humble than the calculate based along the IPC . The dispute stem from vary interpretation of the data related to component lend to acuate food insecurity . Data gap and challenge Omission of sixteen country because of insufficient attest to produce estimate of citizenry in Crisis operating_room bad ( IPC/ CH Phase three operating_room above , operating_room equivalent ) Bolivia ( Plurinational State of ) , Comoros , Congo , democratic People 's Republic of Korea , Djibouti , syrian refugee in Egypt and Jordan , Eritrea , Iran ( Islamic Republic of ) , Kyrgyzstan , Lao People 's democratic Republic , Nepal , Venezuelan migrant in Peru , philippines and Tajikistan and displace population indium Algeria/Western Sahara . underestimate of number of people indiana Crisis oregon worse ( IPC/CH Phase three oregon above , operating_room equivalent ) for many country Data solicitation be not always national , and may merely learn place in accessible area operating_room those affected aside a place shock . Data solicitation might besides have exist conduct out of the point season operating_room the psychoanalysis make not include a projection for the time of extremum want . indiana addition , the count of citizenry inch Crisis oregon bad ( IPC/CH Phase three operating_room above ) suffice not necessarily reflect the broad population indiana need of pressing action to decrease food break and protect and save life and support . This be because some family may entirely be classified_ad in IPC/CH Phase one oregon two because they receive aid , and exist indiana fact in need of continue action . The act in Crisis operating_room worse ( IPC/CH Phase three oregon above ) refer to population in indigence of action far to that already carry . Absence of estimate for population in stressed ( IPC/CH Phase two ) pending data source Bangladesh , Burundi , Iraq , Libya , Nicaragua , Rwanda , Uganda and Ukraine . This equal chiefly the lawsuit when use FEWS NET , HNOs oregon to a less extent WFP analyze arsenic the beginning . Lack of datum handiness and comparison for refugee food security Refugee food security_system be quantify indium versatile ways across refugee population and data be not systematically collect , disaggregated , consolidate operating_room share . detailed , comparative psychoanalysis along refugee food security astatine country , regional operating_room global level be not possible with current system and process , and particularly not in a comparable way to IPC/CH protocol . restrict handiness and frequency of home nutriment survey and/or IPC acute malnutrition analyze only ten area – Chad , Kenya , Madagascar , Mozambique , the Niger , Nigeria , Pakistan , Somalia , South Sudan and Uganda – behave an IPC acute malnutrition analysis in 2019 . limited predictive psychoanalysis ( acute food insecurity and malnutrition ) For respective country with no IPC/CH oregon compatible product where alternative estimate be use , predictive analyze embody not available . in some case where IPC/CH equal secondhand , data collection and analysis update equal not angstrom frequent angstrom might be want to provide estimate for the forecast section of this report . IPC-compatible analyze offer image value for bode preferably than accurate estimate . not all area with a 2019 IPC acute malnutrition analysis own a projection beyond publication of the GRFC 2020 . Comparability challenge most IPC solution show indiana this report be based along the IPC Technical Manual Version 3.0 , which be plunge indium April 2019 and CH Technical Manual Version 2.0 for psychoanalysis carry out indiana October–November 2019 . The use of these revise protocol cause not involve the comparison of act of food-insecure people with previous analysis period and between area . For some state , the coverage of food security analysis inside and between old_age change indium term of population ( e.g . rural entirely vs. rural and urban ) and/or area analyze ( e.g . part of the state vs. hale area ) . This affect the comparison of the number of acutely food-insecure citizenry between time menstruation . in a few nation ( e.g . Bangladesh , Burundi , Djibouti ) , no IPC acute food insecurity analysis be behave in 2019 . depend on whether other comparable source of information could be found , this shackle comparison with previous long_time and highlight the importance for food-crisis country to demeanor an IPC analysis at least once a year . not collected/ sphere equal inaccessible not comparable across prison_term oregon geographic area confused across respective source not disaggregated aside age , gender operating_room IPC/CH phase incomplete Data toilet be miss because information_technology be INTRODUCTION AND METHODS GLOBAL REPORT ON FOOD CRISES 2020 | nineteen Chapter two begin with a graphic and textual analysis of the winder witness of the GRFC 2020 . information_technology leave the chief list of fifty-five country and district in food crisis , issue the extremum number of astutely food-insecure people in 2019 . denote to the rest of the chapter for regional overview of 2019 food crisis for which datum cost available : three area of Africa ; Asia and the Middle East ; Latin America and the Caribbean . chapter three cover the thirty-five most dangerous food crisis in alphabetic order from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe . there be a graphic overview page for each country crisis provide the key relevant food security and nutrition data ; a drumhead of the chief driver in order of their contribution to the country ’ south food crisis and the displacement calculate that be most relevant for the country/territory .

Over half of the 77 million acutely foodinsecure people in countries where conflict was identified as the\\nprimary driver were in the Middle East and Asia. Regional crises\\ncontinued to see high levels of acute food insecurity, particularly\\nin the Lake Chad Basin and Central Sahel.\\nAfrica had the largest numbers of acutely food-insecure people in\\nneed of assistance in countries badly affected by weather events,\\nparticularly in the Horn of Africa and Southern Africa, followed by\\nCentral America and Pakistan.\\nIn East Africa, armed conflicts, intercommunal violence and\\nother localized tensions continued to affect peace and security,\\nparticularly in South Sudan, and continued to maintain large\\nrefugee populations in neighbouring countries, such as Uganda.\\nThe report reflects the growing influence of economic crises\\non acute food insecurity levels, particularly in the Bolivarian\\nRepublic of Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Haiti and the Sudan.\\nAn estimated 79 million people remained displaced globally\\nas of mid-2019 – 44 million of them internally displaced and\\n20 million were refugees under UNHCR’s mandate.

By 11 April, 1.6 million cases\\nand nearly 100 000 deaths had occurred globally (WHO,\\n11 April 2020).\\nWhile COVID-19 does not discriminate, the 55 countries and\\nterritories that are home to 135 million acutely food-insecure\\npeople in need of urgent humanitarian food and nutrition\\nassistance are the most vulnerable to the consequences of this\\npandemic as they have very limited or no capacity to cope with\\neither the health or socioeconomic aspects of the shock.\\nThese countries may face an excruciating trade-off between\\nsaving lives or livelihoods or, in a worst-case scenario, saving\\npeople from the corona virus to have them die from hunger. To\\nprevent these tens of millions of people already facing food crises\\nfrom succumbing to the virus or to its economic consequences,\\nall actors need to mobilize and coordinate along a set of\\noperational and strategic priorities.\\nIn addition to the countries covered in the GRFC 2020, the\\npandemic may drive up acute food insecurity levels in other\\ncountries. For instance, Small Island Developing States (SIDS)\\nand oil-exporting countries may be severely affected as they are\\nnet importers of food with populations that are dependent on\\nincome from remittances and tourism.\\nThe impact on health and nutrition\\nIn most of the countries covered in this report, national health\\nsystems are already over-stretched, with an alarming dearth of\\nequipment, medicines and trained staff.\\nPoor people, including displaced people, often lack sufficient\\neconomic resources to access health care and/or live in remote\\nareas far from services. Some groups are fearful of being\\nstigmatized or discriminated against in accessing public services.\\nPeople in food crises often have higher rates of underlying\\nhealth conditions, including non-communicable diseases and\\nmalnutrition (acute, chronic and micronutrient deficiencies),\\nwhich weaken the immune system and increase the risk of\\npeople developing severe COVID-19 symptoms.\\nRising levels of food insecurity and lack of access to healthcare –\\neither because of movement restrictions, strained health systems\\nor falling incomes – are likely to increase malnutrition rates,\\nparticularly among children, pregnant and lactating women and\\nthe elderly.\\nThere are also urgent concerns for the nutritional status of\\nchildren in families that rely on school feeding programmes to fill\\nfood gaps.\\nThe impact on food availability\\nOn the food supply side, harvests have been good and the 2020\\noutlook for staple crops is promising. However, movement\\nrestrictions necessary to contain the spread of the virus will\\ndisrupt the transport and processing of food and other critical\\ngoods, increasing delivery times and reducing availability of\\neven the most basic food items. For households dependent on\\nfood production and livestock rearing, any disruption in the\\nsupply chain of agricultural inputs or the inability to access\\nlivestock markets, will likely lead to declines in crop and livestock\\nproduction and sales.\\nThe food security consequences of the pandemic on nomadic\\nand semi-nomadic pastoralists will likely be grave if national\\ngovernments close borders, disrupting livestock migration routes,\\nincluding across the fragile Sahel region. In countries where\\ncrop and livestock production are affected by the desert locust\\noutbreak, the restrictions on movement may hinder locust control\\noperations with dramatic consequences for crop production.\\nThe impact on food access\\nRising unemployment and under-employment is likely to\\nseverely reduce people’s purchasing power. Urban populations,\\nparticularly daily wage earners in the informal economies and\\nservice sector employees, are particularly at risk of losing their\\nincome sources as a result of regulations on social distancing and\\ngovernment restrictions to minimize transmission.\\nThose who are reliant on remittances to meet their basic needs\\nand those who cross borders on a regular basis to engage in\\nlivelihood activities will lose their income sources. As households\\nface reduced purchasing power, there is great potential for a\\ndecline in consumer demand – particularly for higher value\\nproducts – further weakening the income of producers, including\\nthose who produce high-value food products.\\nPandemic alert\\nMobilizing for the impact of\\nCOVID-19 in food-crisis countries\\nPANDEMIC ALERT\\nGLOBAL REPORT ON FOOD CRISES 2020 | 5\\nMovement restrictions (and illness) are likely to limit the\\navailability of agricultural labour, which will contribute to\\nrising food prices.

However, these\\nsignificant differences in external assistance provided between\\ncountries must again be considered in the light of the variety of\\ncontexts and the various levels of domestic response provided by\\ngovernments to food crisis situations (i.e. domestic response is\\nnot considered in the analysis presented here).\\nLooking at investment in development, the analysis revealed\\nthat the 32 countries/territories with major food crises received\\nsignificant development assistance (USD 4.2 billion) for food\\nsecurity, agriculture and nutrition sectors in 2017 (figure 3).\\nThis represented roughly 40 percent of the total ODA (official\\ndevelopment assistance) for these three sectors to food-crisis\\ncountries in 2017.\\nOverall, around USD 4.2 billion was allocated to development\\nand USD 6 billion to humanitarian assistance in food-related\\nsectors in the 32 countries in 2017. In many countries,\\nespecially those affected by protracted conflict, the spending on\\nhumanitarian assistance far outweighed that on development\\nassistance (figure 4).\\nFor instance, in 2017 South Sudan received almost USD 700\\nmillion in humanitarian assistance and less than USD 200 million\\nfor development.\\nIn Yemen, also in 2017, humanitarian assistance reached more\\nthan USD 1 billion, while less than USD 100 million was provided\\nfor development assistance. Some countries had more balanced\\nspending on the humanitarian and development assistance. The\\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo received comparable levels\\nof humanitarian and development assistance, though both were\\nlimited. Ethiopia represents another case where the assistance is\\nbalanced and large-scale, most probably due to the presence of\\nrelatively stable and well-established investment environment\\nand policy frameworks.\\nThere is much room to improve the coordination between\\nhumanitarian and development efforts in order to enhance\\nFigure 4\\nHumanitarian assistance and development assistance\\nto food crises in USD in 2017\\nUSD\\n1.04B\\nUSD\\n0.69B\\nUSD\\n0.16B\\nUSD\\n0.14B\\nUSD\\n0.58B\\nUSD\\n0.09B\\nUSD\\n0.18B USD\\n0.06B\\nUSD\\n0.14B\\nUSD\\n0.65B\\nFood security, nutrition and agriculture humanitarian assistance\\nFood security, nutrition and agriculture development assistance\\nDEMOCRATIC\\nREPUBLIC\\nOF THE CONGO\\nYEMEN SOUTH SUDAN ETHIOPIA SUDAN\\nSource: GNAFC 2019, based on data extracted from OECD CRS\\nFigure 3\\nDevelopment assistance in food crises\\nin 2016 and 2017\\nFood security, nutrition and agriculture development assistance to 32 major food crises\\nFood security, nutrition and agriculture development assistance to other countries\\nUSD 4.2B\\nUSD 4.0B\\n63% 37% 2017\\n64% 36% 2016\\nimpact and address the root causes of protracted crises.

It identifies the main drivers of acute food insecurity\\nand malnutrition – and explores whether and how conflict,\\nweather extremes and economic shocks interact and\\nexacerbate food crisis situations. It also examines how\\nchronic, structural or seasonal issues combine with shocks to\\nexacerbate situations.\\nThe data and evidence presented here can inform costefficient and needs-based humanitarian and resiliencebuilding actions, and ultimately enable agencies to seek\\nhigh-level political action and coordinate policies and actions\\nfor durable and innovative ways to tackle the root causes of\\nfood crises. In concrete terms, agencies, governments and\\nThe Global Network Against Food Crises was co-founded\\nby the European Union, FAO and WFP at the 2016 World\\nHumanitarian Summit (WHS) in response to the call for\\nnew approaches to tackle protracted crises and recurrent\\ndisasters, reduce vulnerability and better manage risks by\\nbridging the divide between development, humanitarian\\nand conflict-preventing action. The latter is often referred to\\nas the humanitarian–development–peace (HDP) nexus.\\nThe Global Network brings together partners from across\\nthe spectrum of interventions to tackle food crises,\\nincorporating humanitarian and development actions and\\nlinking to other sectors, such as education, health, the\\nenvironment and peace. It aims to develop evidence-based\\napproaches, build capacities and provide knowledge to\\nmore effectively prevent, prepare for and respond to food\\ncrises, ultimately contributing to longer-term recovery,\\ndevelopment and resilience-building efforts.\\nThe Global Network addresses the multiple facets of food\\ncrises that cannot be successfully tackled by individual\\nactors working under their own specific mandates. It\\nfacilitates a fundamental change in the way international\\nand local actors interact and promotes a holistic approach\\nto address food crises worldwide. Partners in the Global\\nNetwork work together and achieve results at national,\\nregional and global level in three key areas:\\n• Evidence-based analyses of food crisis risks and of\\npeople’s resilience to various shocks; knowledge\\nmanagement and communication monitoring,\\nevaluation and learning.\\n• Strategic investments for addressing and preventing\\nfood crises.\\n• Synergies and coordination with other sectors to address\\nthe full spectrum of humanitarian, development and\\npeace-building needs. This aims to deliver a more\\ninclusive, equitable, resilient and sustainable set of\\ncontext-specific responses and solutions.\\nWithin the Global Network’s framework and approach,\\nthe Food Security Information Network (FSIN) facilitates\\nthe consensus-building process around food security\\nand nutrition analyses, and ensures a constant flow of\\ninformation and exchange between stakeholders at\\ncountry, regional and global level around food security and\\nnutrition analysis.\\nINTRODUCTION AND METHODS\\nGLOBAL REPORT ON FOOD CRISES 2020 | 11\\nother key stakeholders can use the information to bolster the\\ncase for changing food systems, building resilience to extreme\\nweather events, resolving conflict, promoting durable peace\\nand upholding international humanitarian law.\\nThis report is the flagship publication of a series of analytical\\nproducts facilitated by the Food Security Information Network\\n(FSIN) and produced under the initiative of the Global\\nNetwork Against Food Crises.\\nThe humanitarian-development-peace (HDP) nexus has\\nemerged as a major focus of policy debate in the years since\\nthe United Nations Secretary General’s 2015 report for the\\nWorld Humanitarian Summit. The Commitment to Action\\nsigned at the WHS called on humanitarian, development and\\nother relevant actors to work collaboratively towards collective\\noutcomes that reduce needs, risks and vulnerabilities over\\nmultiple years through a “New Way of Working”.\\nFunding and financing tools, instruments, policies and\\napproaches have not had time to adapt to the new HDP\\npolicy agenda proposed at the WHS. Moreover, practical\\nchallenges in the operationalization of the humanitarian and\\ndevelopment collaboration in links with peace are emerging.\\nIn particular, stakeholders at country level report lack of\\nclarity regarding roles and rules of engagement, as well as\\nsignificant divergences in principles and practices, limiting the\\nconvergence between actors along the nexus.\\nThe Global Network Against Food Crises is an attempt to foster\\ngreater collaboration and cohesive action along the nexus.\\nWHAT IS FOOD INSECURITY?\\nFood insecurity refers to the lack of secure access to sufficient\\namounts of safe and nutritious food for normal human growth\\nand development and an active and healthy life. For people\\nto be food secure, food must be both consistently available\\nand accessible in sufficient quantities and diversity and\\nhouseholds must be able to utilize (store, cook, prepare and\\nshare) the food in a way that has a positive nutritional impact.\\nAcute food insecurity\\nAcute food insecurity is any manifestation of food insecurity\\nat a specific point in time of a severity that threatens lives,\\nlivelihoods or both, regardless of the causes, context or\\nduration. These acute states are highly susceptible to\\nchange and can manifest in a population within a short\\namount of time, as a result of sudden changes or shocks that\\nnegatively impact on the determinants of food insecurity\\nand malnutrition (IPC, 2019). Transitory food insecurity is a\\nshort-term or temporary inability to meet food consumption\\nrequirements related to sporadic crises, indicating a capacity\\nto recover.\\nChronic food insecurity\\nChronic food Insecurity is a long-term or persistent inability\\nto meet dietary energy requirements (lasting for a significant\\nperiod of time during the year), FAO defines this as\\n'undernourishment' and it is the basis for the SDG indicator\\n2.1.1 published in SOFI.\\nPeople experiencing moderate food insecurity face\\nuncertainties about their ability to obtain food and have been\\nforced to reduce, at times during the year, the quality and/or\\nquantity of food they consume due to lack of money or other\\nresources. It thus refers to a lack of consistent access to food,\\nwhich diminishes dietary quality, disrupts normal eating\\npatterns, and can have negative consequences for nutrition,\\nhealth and well-being. People facing severe food insecurity,\\non the other hand, have likely run out of food, experienced\\nhunger and, at the most extreme, gone for days without\\neating, putting their health and well-being at grave risk (FAO\\net al., 2019).\\nIn 2018 'More than 820 million people in the world were\\nundernourished; […] more than 700 million people were\\nexposed to severe levels of food insecurity' and 'an additional\\n1.3 billion people, have experienced food insecurity at\\nmoderate levels' (The State of Food Security and Nutrition in\\nthe World 2019).\\nDrivers of acute food insecurity\\nThe drivers of acute food insecurity are often interlinked\\nand mutually reinforcing, making it difficult to pinpoint the\\nspecific trigger or driver of each food crisis. The GRFC 2020\\ntakes a practical approach by estimating which are the most\\nsalient for each country/territory out of the broad categories\\nexplained below.\\nConflict/insecurity\\nThis includes interstate conflicts, internal violence, regional\\nor global instability, civil unrest or political crises leading to\\ndisplacements.\\nIn conflict civilians are frequently deprived of their income\\nsources and pushed into acute food insecurity. Food systems\\nand markets are disrupted, pushing up food prices and\\nsometimes leading to scarcities of water and fuel, or of food\\nitself. Landmines, explosive remnants of war and improvised\\nexplosive devices often destroy agricultural land, mills,\\nstorage facilities, machinery etc.\\nConflict prevents businesses from operating and weakens\\nthe national economy, reducing employment opportunities,\\nincreasing poverty levels and diverting government spending\\ntowards the war effort. Health systems are usually damaged\\nor destroyed leaving people reliant on humanitarian\\nsupport – yet increasingly insecurity and roadblocks prevent\\nhumanitarian convoys from reaching the most vulnerable. Or \\n12 | GLOBAL REPORT ON FOOD CRISES 2020\\nINTRODUCTION AND METHODS\\naid agencies face lengthy delays, restrictions on personnel\\nor the type or quantity of aid supplies, or insufficient security\\nguarantees. Parties to conflict can deny people access to\\nfood as a weapon of war, especially in areas under blockade/\\nembargo. Food insecurity itself can become a trigger for\\nviolence and instability, particularly in contexts marked by\\npervasive inequalities and fragile institutions. Sudden spikes\\nin food prices tend to exacerbate the risk of political unrest\\nand conflict (FAO et al., 2017).\\nWeather extremes\\nThese include droughts, floods and the untimely start of rainy\\nseasons.\\nWeather-related events can directly affect crops and/or\\nlivestock, cut off roads and prevent markets from being\\nstocked. Poor harvests push up food prices and diminish\\nagricultural employment opportunities, lowering income at\\na time when households are more market-reliant because of\\nreduced food stocks.\\nAdverse weather events are particularly grave for smallholder\\nfarmers who cannot afford to invest in the systems and inputs\\nrequired to withstand and recover from the impacts of such\\nshocks, and for pastoralists who are vulnerable because they\\nrely on rain-fed rangeland for grazing livestock and have very\\nfew fixed assets.\\nPeople’s vulnerability to weather shock events rests on their\\ncapacity to adapt, the scale and frequency of shocks and their\\ndependence on the affected sector. Repeated events further\\nerode capacity to withstand future shocks. Weather events\\nand changes in climate can often lead to an intensification of\\nconflict between pastoralist herders and farmers over access\\nto water and grazing. There is ample evidence suggesting\\nthat natural disasters – particularly droughts – contribute to\\naggravating existing civil conflicts.\\nEconomic shocks\\nEconomic shocks can affect the food insecurity of households\\nor individuals through various channels. Macroeconomic\\nshocks, characterized by high inflation or hyperinflation,\\nsignificant currency depreciation, worsening terms of trade,\\nhigh unemployment rates and loss of income, a significant\\ncontraction in exports and a critical decrease in investments\\nand other capital inflows tend to coincide with increases in\\nacute food insecurity. Increases in prices of staple grains, oil or\\nagricultural inputs can affect food availability, food prices and\\nincomes. Microeconomic shocks are characterized by rising\\nfood prices, lack of income sources and consequent reduction\\nin purchasing power, which directly affect households' food\\nsecurity.\\nCountries with weak governance and institutions, or facing\\narmed conflict, civil unrest or instability, are particularly\\nvulnerable to the impact of economic decline. High debt\\nconstrains economic growth, increases vulnerability to\\neconomic shocks and detracts from development spending.\\nOther drivers\\nOther drivers are used in the GRFC but are not recorded as the\\nprimary driver in any of the countries analysed.\\nHealth shocks Disease outbreaks (occurrence of disease\\ncases in excess of normal expectancy) are usually caused by\\nan infection, transmitted through person-to-person contact,\\nanimal-to-person contact, or from the environment or other\\nmedia. Water, sanitation, food and air quality are vital\\nelements in the transmission of communicable diseases and\\nin the spread of diseases prone to cause epidemics. Displaced\\npopulations – particularly in overcrowded camps – are more\\nsusceptible to disease outbreaks which strained health\\nsystems cannot prevent or control (WHO).\\nEpidemics and pandemics can also affect the ability of people\\nto carry on their activities and livelihoods and, in the worst\\ncases when widespread, may also affect markets and supply\\nchains.\\nCrop pests and animal diseases Fall armyworms, desert\\nlocusts, etc can damage crops and may lead to severe\\nproduction shortfalls. Peste des petits ruminants (PPR), footand-mouth disease (FMD), or Rift Valley fever (RVF) often affect\\nlivestock and pastoralists' livelihoods in food-crisis contexts.\\nNatural disasters (non-weather related) Disasters such\\nas earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions can lead to\\nmajor property, infrastructure and/or environmental damage\\nas well as loss of human life.\\nDisplacement\\nDisplacement is often a side-effect of conflict, food insecurity\\nand weather shocks. Displaced people are often more\\nvulnerable to food insecurity and malnutrition having had\\nto abandon their livelihoods and assets, undertake arduous\\njourneys and settle in areas or camps with limited access to\\nbasic services or former social networks. Their rights are often\\nrestricted due to host country legal frameworks, resulting in a\\nlack of access to land, employment and freedom of movement.\\nThey are often dependent on humanitarian assistance to meet\\ntheir food needs.\\nForced displacement is the movement of people who have\\nbeen obliged to leave their homes, particularly to avoid the\\neffects of armed conflict, generalized violence, violations of\\nhuman rights or natural or human-made disasters.\\nA refugee is someone who has been forced to flee his or her\\ncountry because of persecution, war or violence.

Undernutrition is more\\nthan a lack of food – it is a combination of factors: insufficient\\nenergy, protein and micronutrients exacerbated by frequent\\ninfections or disease. Malnutrition stunts children’s growth,\\ndeprives them of essential vitamins and minerals, and makes\\nthem more susceptible to frequent and severe disease and\\ninfections (UNICEF).\\nThere are also other forms of malnutrition. While not a focus of\\nthis report, it may also refer to overnutrition leading to obesity.\\nThis form of malnutrition is on the rise in almost every country\\nin the world. Undernutrition and overnutrition frequently\\ncoexist within the same country, community, and even within\\nthe same individual. Stunted children, for example, face a\\ngreater risk of becoming overweight as adults (UNICEF).\\nAcute malnutrition\\nA child being too thin for his or her height as a result of rapid\\nweight loss or the failure to gain weight is a sign of acute\\nmalnutrition (wasting) which, although treatable, can lead\\nto illness, disability or death. Moderate acute malnutrition\\n(MAM) using the weight for height indicator is identified by\\nweight for height z scores (WHZ) below -2 and above -3 of the\\nreference population, and severe acute malnutrition (SAM)\\nby WHZ below -3. Global acute malnutrition (GAM) reflects\\nboth MAM and SAM in a population. Acute malnutrition can\\nalso be defined by Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC)\\nmeasurements ≤ 12.5 cm, with severe acute malnutrition\\ndefined with a measurement of ≤11.5 cm. Children affected\\nrequire urgent feeding, treatment and care to survive. Acute\\nmalnutrition rates depict the nutrition situation in the general\\npopulation at a specific time: they can show marked seasonal\\npatterns and can change quickly over time. See table 2.\\nChronic malnutrition\\nA child being too short for his or her age (stunting) is considered\\nchronically malnourished. This condition is preventable from\\nthe 1 000 days between a woman’s pregnancy and the time her\\nchild turns two. The physical and cognitive damage caused by\\nstunting can be irreversible and has far-reaching consequences,\\nfrom diminished learning and school performance to lower\\nfuture earnings, and can affect the next generation. Stunted\\nchildren under 5 years old are identified by a height for age\\nz score (HAZ) below -2 of the reference population. Severe\\nstunting is defined as HAZ below -3. See table 3.\\nMicronutrient deficiencies\\nDeficiencies of vitamin A, iron and zinc are often referred to as\\n‘hidden' hunger because it develops gradually over time, and\\na large percentage of the population may be deficient without\\nshowing any clinical symptoms or signs of deficiency.\\nDrivers of malnutrition in food crises\\nThe immediate cause of acute malnutrition is a severe\\nnutritional restriction either as a result of inadequate food\\nintake, or a recent bout of illness, such as diarrhoea, that\\nhinders appropriate intake and absorption of nutrients. The\\ndeterminants of malnutrition also include inadequate access\\nto healthcare, water and sanitation services, inappropriate\\nchild feeding and care practices, as described in the UNICEF\\nframework .\\nChildren require an adequate amount of nutrient dense\\nfoods for their optimum growth and development, to build\\nimmunity to infections and protect against disease. Exclusive\\nbreastfeeding in the first six months of life followed by\\nthe timely introduction of safe and nutritionally adequate\\ncomplementary foods with continued breastfeeding until\\n2 years of age or beyond, ensures children receive all the\\nnutrients they need. Pregnant and lactating women also need\\nto consume foods from a variety of food groups, with adequate\\nand appropriate nutrients and energy to meet the increased\\nphysiological requirements, to sustain healthy fetal growth\\nand development, and support lactation.\\nDuring humanitarian crises, access to nutritious foods may\\nbe limited by food shortages or disrupted food systems\\nPrevalence Label\\nranges\\n< 2.5% Very low\\n2.5–< 5% Low\\n5–< 10% Medium\\n10–< 15% High\\n≥ 15% Very high\\nPrevalence Label\\nranges\\n< 2.5% Very low\\n2.5–10% Low\\n10–< 20% Medium\\n20–<30% High\\n≥ 30% Very high\\nTable 2\\nSeverity index for prevalence of wasting in children\\naged 6–59 months\\nTable 3\\nSeverity index for prevalence of stunting in children\\naged 0–59 months\\nDe Onis et al.

These\\ninclude representative SMART (Standardized Monitoring and\\nAssessment for Relief and Transitions) surveys, Demographic\\nand Health Surveys (DHS), Multiple Indicators Cluster Surveys\\n(MICS), National Vulnerability Assessments and Analysis, and\\nInfant and Young Child Feeding – Knowledge Attitude and\\nPractices Assessments (IYCF KAP). For refugee populations\\nnutrition data comes from UNHCR Standardized Expanded\\nNutrition Surveys (SENS).\\nThe GRFC uses the Joint Child Malnutrition Estimates 2019\\n(UNICEF, WHO, WB) for the number of children affected by\\nstunting and acute malnutrition globally. In chapter 3, it uses\\nin-country calculations approved by the nutrition clusters/\\nsectors and shared in key planning documents such as\\nHNOs and Humanitarian Response Plans (HRP) including\\nprojections. For the drivers, it consults the above surveys and\\nWHO, UNICEF, OCHA, ACAPS, UNHCR and other sources.\\nIn 2019, 10 countries (Chad, Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique,\\nthe Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Uganda, Somalia and South\\nSudan) conducted an IPC acute malnutrition analysis in areas\\nknown to have high rates of acute malnutrition. The results of\\nthese analyses are shared in this report.\\nThe IPC analysis process reviews all contributing factors\\naffecting acute malnutrition in the area of analysis and\\nclassifies the severity of a nutrition situation in a population,\\nusing defined indicators. See table 4 below. The level of\\nGlobal Acute Malnutrition (GAM) is used to classify the\\nseverity of acute malnutrition and key factors such as dietary\\nintake, disease, feeding and care practices, health and WASH\\nenvironment and contextual information such as access to\\nservices, mortality etc are all included in the analysis.\\nPriority response objectives\\nINTRODUCTION AND METHODS\\nGLOBAL REPORT ON FOOD CRISES 2020 | 17\\nMinimum dietary diversity\\nfor children aged 6–23 months\\nThis indicator refers to the percentage of children aged\\n6–23 months who receive foods from more than five out\\nof eight food groups a day. The eight food groups are:\\ni. breastmilk; ii. grains, roots and tubers; iii. legumes\\nand nuts; iv. dairy products (infant formula, milk,\\nyogurt, cheese); v. flesh foods (meat, fish, poultry and\\nliver/organ meats); vi. eggs; vii. vitamin-A rich fruits and\\nvegetables; viii. other fruits and vegetables.\\nIn some surveys minimum dietary diversity is calculated\\nbased on seven food groups, excluding breastmilk. In\\nthese cases, the indicator refers to the percentage of\\nchildren aged 6–23 months who receive foods from\\nmore than four out of seven food groups a day.\\nMinimum meal frequency\\nThe indicator refers to the proportion of breastfed and\\nnon-breastfed children aged 6–23 months who receive\\nsolid, semi-solid or soft foods at least the minimum\\nnumber of recommended times a day.\\nMinimum acceptable diet\\nThis composite indicator combines meal frequency and\\ndietary diversity to assess the proportion of children\\naged 6–23 months consuming a diet that meets the\\nminimum requirements for growth and development.\\nPercentage of households not consuming\\nmicronutrient-rich food (analysed in refugee\\npopulations)\\nThis refers to the proportion of households with no\\nmember consuming any vegetables, fruits, meat, eggs,\\nfish/seafood, and milk/milk products over a reference\\nperiod of 24 hours. The food group of vegetables, fruits,\\nmeat, eggs, fish/seafood, and milk/milk products are the\\nsame as the 12 food groups defined by FAO (2011).\\nExclusive breastfeeding\\nThis indicator refers to the percentage of infants fed\\nexclusively with breast milk up to six months of age, as\\nrecommended by WHO.\\nPrevalence of anaemia\\nThis indicator refers to the proportion of children aged\\n6–59 months and of reproductive age women (15–49\\nyears) who are anaemic.\\nAnaemia is a condition in which the number of\\nred blood cells or their oxygen-carrying capacity is\\ninsufficient to meet physiological needs, which varies\\nby age, sex, altitude, smoking and pregnancy status.\\nIron deficiency is thought to be the most common\\ncause of anaemia globally, although other conditions,\\nsuch as folate, vitamin B12 and vitamin A deficiencies,\\nchronic inflammation, parasitic infections and inherited\\ndisorders can all cause anaemia. In its severe form,\\nit is associated with fatigue, weakness, dizziness\\nand drowsiness. Pregnant women and children are\\nparticularly vulnerable (WHO).\\nAccess to basic drinking\\nwater services\\nImproved drinking water sources are those which,\\nby nature of their design and construction, have the\\npotential to deliver safe water. The WHO and UNICEF\\nJoint Monitoring Program for Water Supply Sanitation\\nand Hygiene (JMP) subdivides the population using\\nimproved sources into three groups (safely managed,\\nbasic and limited) according to the level of service\\nprovided. In order to meet the criteria for a safely\\nmanaged drinking water service, people must use an\\nimproved source meeting three criteria: accessible\\non premises; available when needed; free from\\ncontamination.\\nIf the improved source does not meet any one of\\nthese criteria but a round trip to collect water takes 30\\nminutes or less, then it is classified as a basic drinking\\nwater service. If water collection from an improved\\nsource exceeds 30 minutes, it is categorized as a limited\\nservice (WHO and UNICEF).\\nFor refugees, the indicator refers to the type of drinking\\nwater source used by the household and serves to\\nindicate whether their drinking water is of a suitable\\nquality or not.\\nAdditional nutrition indicators used in GRFC 2020\\n18 | GLOBAL REPORT ON FOOD CRISES 2020\\nINTRODUCTION AND METHODS\\nLIMITATIONS\\nConsensus\\nAll partners are in agreement with the approximate degree\\nof magnitude and severity of acute food insecurity indicated\\nfor the countries included in this report, except in the cases of\\nAfghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti and\\nEthiopia, for which FEWS NET’s analyses of available evidence\\nsuggest that the population requiring emergency food\\nassistance in 2019 was lower than the estimates based on the\\nIPC. The differences stem from varying interpretations of the\\ndata related to factors contributing to acute food insecurity.\\nData gaps and challenges\\nOmission of 16 countries because of insufficient evidence\\nto produce estimates of people in Crisis or worse (IPC/\\nCH Phase 3 or above, or equivalent) Bolivia (Plurinational\\nState of), Comoros, Congo, Democratic People's Republic of\\nKorea, Djibouti, Syrian refugees in Egypt and Jordan, Eritrea,\\nIran (Islamic Republic of), Kyrgyzstan, Lao People's Democratic\\nRepublic, Nepal, Venezuelan migrants in Peru, Philippines\\nand Tajikistan and displaced populations in Algeria/Western\\nSahara.\\nUnderestimation of numbers of people in Crisis or\\nworse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above, or equivalent) for many\\ncountries Data collection is not always national, and may only\\ntake place in accessible areas or those affected by a localized\\nshock. Data collection might also have been conducted out of\\nthe peak season or the analysis did not include a projection\\nfor the timing of peak needs. In addition, the number of\\npeople in Crisis or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above) does\\nnot necessarily reflect the full population in need of urgent\\naction to decrease food gaps and protect and save lives\\nand livelihoods. This is because some households may only\\nbe classified in IPC/CH Phase 1 or 2 because they receive\\nassistance, and are in fact in need of continued action. The\\nnumber in Crisis or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above) refers to\\npopulations in need of action further to that already taken.\\nAbsence of estimates for populations in Stressed (IPC/CH\\nPhase 2) pending data sources Bangladesh, Burundi, Iraq,\\nLibya, Nicaragua, Rwanda, Uganda and Ukraine. This is mainly\\nthe case when using FEWS NET, HNOs or to a lesser extent\\nWFP analyses as the source.\\nLack of data availability and comparability for refugee\\nfood security Refugee food security is measured in\\nvarious ways across refugee populations and data are not\\nsystematically collected, disaggregated, consolidated or\\nshared. Detailed, comparative analysis on refugee food\\nsecurity at country, regional or global level is not possible\\nwith current systems and processes, and particularly not in a\\ncomparable way to IPC/CH protocols.\\nLimited availability and frequency of national nutrition\\nsurveys and/or IPC acute malnutrition analyses Only\\n10 countries – Chad, Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, the\\nNiger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Somalia, South Sudan and Uganda –\\nconducted an IPC acute malnutrition analysis in 2019.\\nLimited predictive analysis (acute food insecurity and\\nmalnutrition) For several countries with no IPC/CH or\\ncompatible products where alternative estimates are used,\\npredictive analyses are not available. In some cases where\\nIPC/CH is used, data collection and analysis updates are not\\nas frequent as might be needed to provide estimates for the\\nforecast section of this report. IPC-compatible analyses offer\\nrange values for forecasts rather than precise estimates. Not\\nall countries with a 2019 IPC acute malnutrition analysis had a\\nprojection beyond publication of the GRFC 2020.\\nComparability challenges\\nMost IPC results presented in this report are based on the\\nIPC Technical Manual Version 3.0, which was launched in\\nApril 2019 and CH Technical Manual Version 2.0 for analyses\\ncarried out in October–November 2019. The use of these\\nrevised protocols does not affect the comparability of numbers\\nof food-insecure people with previous analysis periods and\\nbetween countries.\\nFor some countries, the coverage of food security analyses\\nwithin and between years varies in terms of population (e.g.\\nrural only vs. rural and urban) and/or areas analysed (e.g. part\\nof the country vs. whole country). This affects the comparability\\nof the number of acutely food-insecure people between\\ntime periods. In a few countries (e.g. Bangladesh, Burundi,\\nDjibouti), no IPC acute food insecurity analysis was conducted\\nin 2019. Depending on whether other comparable sources of\\ninformation could be found, this hampers comparability with\\nprevious years and highlights the importance for food-crisis\\ncountries to conduct an IPC analysis at least once a year.\\nnot collected/\\narea is inaccessible\\nnot comparable across time\\nor geographical areas\\nscattered across\\nvarious sources\\nnot disaggregated by age,\\ngender or IPC/CH phases\\nincomplete\\nData can be missing because it is\\nINTRODUCTION AND METHODS\\nGLOBAL REPORT ON FOOD CRISES 2020 | 19\\nChapter 2 starts with a graphical and textual analysis of the key findings of the\\nGRFC 2020. It provides the main list of 55 countries and territories in food crises,\\nsupplying the peak number of acutely food-insecure people in 2019.\\nRefer to the rest of the chapter for regional overviews of 2019 food crises for which\\ndata was available: three regions of Africa; Asia and the Middle East; Latin America\\nand the Caribbean.\\nChapter 3 covers the 35 most serious food crises in alphabetical order from\\nAfghanistan to Zimbabwe. There is a graphical overview page for each country\\ncrisis providing the key relevant food security and nutrition data; a summary of\\nthe main drivers in order of their contribution to the country’s food crisis and the\\ndisplacement figures that are most relevant for the country/territory.\\nThe rest of each country profile provides a more granular analysis of the acute food\\ninsecurity and nutrition situation in 2019 and discusses the drivers in some depth.\\nEach profile is illustrated with maps that give a sense of severity by region and,\\nwhere possible, graphs that convey changes over time.\\nChapter 4 provides a table with pre-COVID-19 pandemic estimates of the number\\nof acutely food-insecure people in need of urgent action in 2020.\\nIt further provides an analysis of expected trends by country/territory in 2020. It\\nexplains the assumptions underlying the acute food insecurity forecasts for 2020.\\nRegional maps of Africa, Asia and Latin America/Caribbean indicate the projected\\nranges of the numbers of people in IPC/CH Phase 3 or above as well as primary\\ndrivers and risks by country.\\nHow to use this report\\nURGENT CALL TO ACTION TO\\nIMPROVE DATA ANALYTICS\\n\""
